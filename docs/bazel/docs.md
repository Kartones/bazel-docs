# Commands and Options

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page covers the options that are available with various Bazel commands,
such as `bazel build`, `bazel run`, and `bazel test`. This page is a companion
to the list of Bazel's commands in [Build with Bazel](/run/build).

## Target syntax {:#target-syntax}

Some commands, like `build` or `test`, can operate on a list of targets. They
use a syntax more flexible than labels, which is documented in
[Specifying targets to build](/run/build#specifying-build-targets).

## Options {:#build-options}

The following sections describe the options available during a
build. When `--long` is used on a help command, the on-line
help messages provide summary information about the meaning, type and
default value for each option.

Most options can only be specified once. When specified multiple times, the
last instance wins. Options that can be specified multiple times are
identified in the on-line help with the text 'may be used multiple times'.

### Package location {:#package-location}

#### `--package_path` {:#package-path}

**WARNING:** The `--package_path` option is deprecated. Bazel prefers packages
in the main repository to be under the workspace root.

This option specifies the set of directories that are searched to
find the BUILD file for a given package.

Bazel finds its packages by searching the package path. This is a colon
separated ordered list of bazel directories, each being the root of a
partial source tree.

_To specify a custom package path_ using the `--package_path` option:

<pre>
  % bazel build --package_path %workspace%:/some/other/root
</pre>

Package path elements may be specified in three formats:

1.  If the first character is `/`, the path is absolute.
2.  If the path starts with `%workspace%`, the path is taken relative
    to the nearest enclosing bazel directory.
    For instance, if your working directory
    is `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, then the
    string `%workspace%` in the package-path is expanded
    to `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel`.
3.  Anything else is taken relative to the working directory.
    This is usually not what you mean to do,
    and may behave unexpectedly if you use Bazel from directories below the bazel workspace.
    For instance, if you use the package-path element `.`,
    and then cd into the directory
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, packages
    will be resolved from the
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo` directory.

If you use a non-default package path, specify it in your
[Bazel configuration file](/run/bazelrc) for convenience.

_Bazel doesn't require any packages to be in the
current directory_, so you can do a build from an empty bazel
workspace if all the necessary packages can be found somewhere else
on the package path.

Example: Building from an empty client

<pre>
  % mkdir -p foo/bazel
  % cd foo/bazel
  % touch MODULE.bazel
  % bazel build --package_path /some/other/path //foo
</pre>

#### `--deleted_packages` {:flag--deleted_packages}

This option specifies a comma-separated list of packages which Bazel
should consider deleted, and not attempt to load from any directory
on the package path. This can be used to simulate the deletion of packages without
actually deleting them. This option can be passed multiple times, in which case
the individual lists are concatenated.

### Error checking {:#error-checking}

These options control Bazel's error-checking and/or warnings.

#### `--[no]check_visibility` {:#check-visibility}

If this option is set to false, visibility checks are demoted to warnings.
The default value of this option is true, so that by default, visibility
checking is done.

#### `--output_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-filter}

The `--output_filter` option will only show build and compilation
warnings for targets that match the regular expression. If a target does not
match the given regular expression and its execution succeeds, its standard
output and standard error are thrown away.

Here are some typical values for this option:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//(first/project|second/project):'`</td>
    <td>Show the output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//((?!(first/bad_project|second/bad_project):).)*$'`</td>
    <td>Don't show output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=`</td>
    <td>Show everything.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=DONT_MATCH_ANYTHING`</td>
    <td>Show nothing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tool flags {:#tool-flags}

These options control which options Bazel will pass to other tools.

#### `--copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler.
The argument will be passed to the compiler whenever it is invoked
for preprocessing, compiling, and/or assembling C, C++, or
assembler code. It will not be passed when linking.

This option can be used multiple times. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-g0" --copt="-fpic" //foo
</pre>

will compile the `foo` library without debug tables, generating
position-independent code.

Note: Changing `--copt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected object files. Also note that copts values listed in specific
cc_library or cc_binary build rules will be placed on the compiler command line
_after_ these options.

Warning: C++-specific options (such as `-fno-implicit-templates`)
should be specified in `--cxxopt`, not in
`--copt`. Likewise, C-specific options (such as -Wstrict-prototypes)
should be specified in `--conlyopt`, not in `copt`.
Similarly, compiler options that only have an
effect at link time (such as `-l`) should be specified in
`--linkopt`, not in `--copt`.

#### `--host_copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--copt`](#copt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-conlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--conlyopt`](#cconlyopt) option, but applies only
to the exec configuration.

#### `--host_cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C++ source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--cxxopt`](#cxxopt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the linker for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--linkopt`](#linkopt) option, but applies only to
the exec configuration.

#### `--conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cconlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when compiling C source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C compilation,
not to C++ compilation or linking. So you can pass C-specific options
(such as `-Wno-pointer-sign`) using `--conlyopt`.

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when
compiling C++ source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C++ compilation,
not to C compilation or linking. So you can pass C++-specific options
(such as `-fpermissive` or `-fno-implicit-templates`) using `--cxxopt`.

For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --cxxopt="-fpermissive" --cxxopt="-Wno-error" //foo/cruddy_code
</pre>

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when linking.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to linking,
not to compilation. So you can pass compiler options that only make sense
at link time (such as `-lssp` or `-Wl,--wrap,abort`)
using `--linkopt`. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-fmudflap" --linkopt="-lmudflap" //foo/buggy_code
</pre>

Build rules can also specify link options in their attributes. This option's
settings always take precedence. Also see
[cc_library.linkopts](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.linkopts).

#### `--strip (always|never|sometimes)` {:#strip}

This option determines whether Bazel will strip debugging information from
all binaries and shared libraries, by invoking the linker with the `-Wl,--strip-debug` option.
`--strip=always` means always strip debugging information.
`--strip=never` means never strip debugging information.
The default value of `--strip=sometimes` means strip if the `--compilation_mode`
is `fastbuild`.

<pre>
  % bazel build --strip=always //foo:bar
</pre>

will compile the target while stripping debugging information from all generated
binaries.

Note: If you want debugging information, it's not enough to disable stripping;
you also need to make sure that the debugging information was generated by the
compiler, which you can do by using either `-c dbg` or `--copt -g`.

Bazel's `--strip` option corresponds with ld's `--strip-debug` option:
it only strips debugging information. If for some reason you want to strip _all_ symbols,
not just _debug_ symbols, you would need to use ld's `--strip-all` option,
which you can do by passing `--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all` to Bazel. Also be
aware that setting Bazel's `--strip` flag will override
`--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all`, so you should only set one or the other.

If you are only building a single binary and want all symbols stripped, you could also
pass `--stripopt=--strip-all` and explicitly build the
`//foo:bar.stripped` version of the target. As described in the section on
`--stripopt`, this applies a strip action after the final binary is
linked rather than including stripping in all of the build's link actions.

#### `--stripopt={{ "<var>" }}strip-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#stripopt}

This is an additional option to pass to the `strip` command when generating
a [`*.stripped` binary](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary_implicit_outputs). The default
is `-S -p`. This option can be used multiple times.

Note: `--stripopt` does not apply to the stripping of the main
binary with `[--strip](#flag--strip)=(always|sometimes)`.

#### `--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}profile-output-dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-instrument}

The `--fdo_instrument` option enables the generation of
FDO (feedback directed optimization) profile output when the
built C/C++ binary is executed. For GCC, the argument provided is used as a
directory prefix for a per-object file directory tree of .gcda files
containing profile information for each .o file.

Once the profile data tree has been generated, the profile tree
should be zipped up, and provided to the
`--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}`
Bazel option to enable the FDO-optimized compilation.

For the LLVM compiler the argument is also the directory under which the raw LLVM profile
data file(s) is dumped. For example:
`--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}/path/to/rawprof/dir/{{ "</var>" }}`.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-optimize}

The `--fdo_optimize` option enables the use of the
per-object file profile information to perform FDO (feedback
directed optimization) optimizations when compiling. For GCC, the argument
provided is the zip file containing the previously-generated file tree
of .gcda files containing profile information for each .o file.

Alternatively, the argument provided can point to an auto profile
identified by the extension .afdo.

Note: This option also accepts labels that resolve to source files. You
may need to add an `exports_files` directive to the corresponding package to
make the file visible to Bazel.

For the LLVM compiler the argument provided should point to the indexed LLVM
profile output file prepared by the llvm-profdata tool, and should have a .profdata
extension.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-language-version}

This option specifies the version of Java sources. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --java_language_version=8 java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

compiles and allows only constructs compatible with Java 8 specification.
Default value is 11. -->
Possible values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 21 and may be extended by
registering custom Java toolchains using `default_java_toolchain`.

#### `--tool_java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-language-version}

The Java language version used to build tools that are executed during a build.
Default value is 11.

#### `--java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-runtime-version}

This option specifies the version of JVM to use to execute the code and run the tests. For
example:

<pre>
  % bazel run --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11 java/com/example/common/foo:java_application
</pre>

downloads JDK 11 from a remote repository and run the Java application using it.

Default value is `local_jdk`.
Possible values are: `local_jdk`, `local_jdk_{{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}`,
`remotejdk_11`, `remotejdk_17`, and `remotejdk_21`.
You can extend the values by registering custom JVM using either
`local_java_repository` or `remote_java_repository` repository rules.

#### `--tool_java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-runtime-version}

The version of JVM used to execute tools that are needed during a build.
Default value is `remotejdk_11`.

#### `--jvmopt={{ "<var>" }}jvm-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#jvmopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to the Java VM. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --jvmopt="-server -Xms256m" java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

will use the server VM for launching all Java binaries and set the
startup heap size for the VM to 256 MB.

#### `--javacopt={{ "<var>" }}javac-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#javacopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to javac. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --javacopt="-g:source,lines" //myprojects:prog
</pre>

will rebuild a java_binary with the javac default debug info
(instead of the bazel default).

The option is passed to javac after the Bazel built-in default options for
javac and before the per-rule options. The last specification of
any option to javac wins. The default options for javac are:

<pre>
  -source 8 -target 8 -encoding UTF-8
</pre>

Note: Changing `--javacopt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected classes. Also note that javacopts parameters listed in
specific java_library or java_binary build rules will be placed on the javac
command line _after_ these options.

#### `--strict_java_deps (default|strict|off|warn|error)` {:#strict-java-deps}

This option controls whether javac checks for missing direct dependencies.
Java targets must explicitly declare all directly used targets as
dependencies. This flag instructs javac to determine the jars actually used
for type checking each java file, and warn/error if they are not the output
of a direct dependency of the current target.

* `off` means checking is disabled.
* `warn` means javac will generate standard java warnings of
  type `[strict]` for each missing direct dependency.
* `default`, `strict` and `error` all
  mean javac will generate errors instead of warnings, causing the current
  target to fail to build if any missing direct dependencies are found.
  This is also the default behavior when the flag is unspecified.

### Build semantics {:#build-semantics}

These options affect the build commands and/or the output file contents.

#### `--compilation_mode (fastbuild|opt|dbg)` (-c) {:#compilation-mode}

The `--compilation_mode` option (often shortened to `-c`,
especially `-c opt`) takes an argument of `fastbuild`, `dbg`
or `opt`, and affects various C/C++ code-generation
options, such as the level of optimization and the completeness of
debug tables. Bazel uses a different output directory for each
different compilation mode, so you can switch between modes without
needing to do a full rebuild _every_ time.

* `fastbuild` means build as fast as possible:
  generate minimal debugging information (`-gmlt
  -Wl,-S`), and don't optimize. This is the
  default. Note: `-DNDEBUG` will **not** be set.
* `dbg` means build with debugging enabled (`-g`),
  so that you can use gdb (or another debugger).
* `opt` means build with optimization enabled and
  with `assert()` calls disabled (`-O2 -DNDEBUG`).
  Debugging information will not be generated in `opt` mode
  unless you also pass `--copt -g`.

#### `--cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cpu}

This option specifies the target CPU architecture to be used for
the compilation of binaries during the build.

Note: A particular combination of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU is allowed only if it has been specified in the currently
used CROSSTOOL file.

#### `--action_env={{ "<var>" }}VAR=VALUE{{ "</var>" }}` {:#action-env}

Specifies the set of environment variables available during the execution of all actions.
Variables can be either specified by name, in which case the value will be taken from the
invocation environment, or by the `name=value` pair which sets the value independent of the
invocation environment.

This `--action_env` flag can be specified multiple times. If a value is assigned to the same
variable across multiple `--action_env` flags, the latest assignment wins.

#### `--experimental_action_listener={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-action-listener}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects)
instead.

The `experimental_action_listener` option instructs Bazel to use
details from the [`action_listener`](/reference/be/extra-actions#action_listener) rule specified by {{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }} to
insert [`extra_actions`](/reference/be/extra-actions#extra_action) into the build graph.

#### `--[no]experimental_extra_action_top_level_only` {:experimental-extra-action-top-level-only}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

If this option is set to true, extra actions specified by the
[ `--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) command
line option will only be scheduled for top level targets.

#### `--experimental_extra_action_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-extra-action-filter}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

The `experimental_extra_action_filter` option instructs Bazel to
filter the set of targets to schedule `extra_actions` for.

This flag is only applicable in combination with the
[`--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) flag.

By default all `extra_actions` in the transitive closure of the
requested targets-to-build get scheduled for execution.
`--experimental_extra_action_filter` will restrict scheduling to
`extra_actions` of which the owner's label matches the specified
regular expression.

The following example will limit scheduling of `extra_actions`
to only apply to actions of which the owner's label contains '/bar/':

<pre>% bazel build --experimental_action_listener=//test:al //foo/... \
  --experimental_extra_action_filter=.*/bar/.*
</pre>

#### `--host_cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cpu}

This option specifies the name of the CPU architecture that should be
used to build host tools.

#### `--android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}platform[,platform]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-platforms}

The platforms to build the transitive `deps` of
`android_binary` rules (specifically for native dependencies like C++). For
example, if a `cc_library` appears in the transitive `deps` of an
`android_binary` rule it is be built once for each platform specified with
`--android_platforms` for the `android_binary` rule, and included in the final
output.

There is no default value for this flag: a custom Android platform must be
defined and used.

One `.so` file is created and packaged in the APK for each platform specified
with `--android_platforms`. The `.so` file's name prefixes the name of the
`android_binary` rule with "lib". For example, if the name of the
`android_binary` is "foo", then the file is `libfoo.so`.

#### `--per_file_copt={{ "<var>" }}[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...{{ "</var>" }}` {:#per-file-copt}

When present, any C++ file with a label or an execution path matching one of the inclusion regex
expressions and not matching any of the exclusion expressions will be built
with the given options. The label matching uses the canonical form of the label
(i.e //`package`:`label_name`).

The execution path is the relative path to your workspace directory including the base name
(including extension) of the C++ file. It also includes any platform dependent prefixes.

Note: If only one of the label or the execution path matches the options will be used.

To match the generated files (such as genrule outputs)
Bazel can only use the execution path. In this case the regexp shouldn't start with '//'
since that doesn't match any execution paths. Package names can be used like this:
`--per_file_copt=base/.*\.pb\.cc@-g0`. This will match every
`.pb.cc` file under a directory called `base`.

This option can be used multiple times.

The option is applied regardless of the compilation mode used. For example, it is possible
to compile with `--compilation_mode=opt` and selectively compile some
files with stronger optimization turned on, or with optimization disabled.

**Caveat**: If some files are selectively compiled with debug symbols the symbols
might be stripped during linking. This can be prevented by setting
`--strip=never`.

**Syntax**: `[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...` Where
`regex` stands for a regular expression that can be prefixed with
a `+` to identify include patterns and with `-` to identify
exclude patterns. `option` stands for an arbitrary option that is passed
to the C++ compiler. If an option contains a `,` it has to be quoted like so
`\,`. Options can also contain `@`, since only the first
`@` is used to separate regular expressions from options.

**Example**:
`--per_file_copt=//foo:.*\.cc,-//foo:file\.cc@-O0,-fprofile-arcs`
adds the `-O0` and the `-fprofile-arcs` options to the command
line of the C++ compiler for all `.cc` files in `//foo/` except `file.cc`.

#### `--dynamic_mode={{ "<var>" }}mode{{ "</var>" }}` {:#dynamic-mode}

Determines whether C++ binaries will be linked dynamically, interacting with
the [linkstatic attribute](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) on build rules.

Modes:

* `default`: Allows bazel to choose whether to link dynamically.
  See [linkstatic](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) for more
  information.
* `fully`: Links all targets dynamically. This will speed up
  linking time, and reduce the size of the resulting binaries.
* `off`: Links all targets in
  [mostly static](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) mode.
  If `-static` is set in linkopts, targets will change to fully static.

#### `--fission (yes|no|[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild])` {:#fission}

Enables [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission){: .external},
which writes C++ debug information to dedicated .dwo files instead of .o files, where it would
otherwise go. This substantially reduces the input size to links and can reduce link times.

When set to `[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild]` (example:
`--fission=dbg,fastbuild`), Fission is enabled
only for the specified set of compilation modes. This is useful for bazelrc
settings. When set to `yes`, Fission is enabled
universally. When set to `no`, Fission is disabled
universally. Default is <code class='flag'>no</code>.

#### `--force_ignore_dash_static` {:#force-ignore-dash-static}

If this flag is set, any `-static` options in linkopts of
`cc_*` rules BUILD files are ignored. This is only intended as a
workaround for C++ hardening builds.

#### `--[no]force_pic` {:#force-pic}

If enabled, all C++ compilations produce position-independent code ("-fPIC"),
links prefer PIC pre-built libraries over non-PIC libraries, and links produce
position-independent executables ("-pie"). Default is disabled.

Note: Dynamically linked binaries (for example `--dynamic_mode fully`)
generate PIC code regardless of this flag's setting. So this flag is for cases
where users want PIC code explicitly generated for static links.

#### `--android_resource_shrinking` {:#flag--android_resource_shrinking}

Selects whether to perform resource shrinking for android_binary rules. Sets the default for the
[shrink_resources attribute](/reference/be/android#android_binary.shrink_resources) on
android_binary rules; see the documentation for that rule for further details. Defaults to off.

#### `--custom_malloc={{ "<var>" }}malloc-library-target{{ "</var>" }}` {:#custom-malloc}

When specified, always use the given malloc implementation, overriding all
`malloc="target"` attributes, including in those targets that use the
default (by not specifying any `malloc`).

#### `--crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#crosstool-top}

This option specifies the location of the crosstool compiler suite
to be used for all C++ compilation during a build. Bazel will look in that
location for a CROSSTOOL file and uses that to automatically determine
settings for `--compiler`.

#### `--host_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-crosstool-top}

If not specified, Bazel uses the value of `--crosstool_top` to compile
code in the exec configuration, such as tools run during the build. The main purpose of this flag
is to enable cross-compilation.

#### `--apple_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#apple-crosstool-top}

The crosstool to use for compiling C/C++ rules in the transitive `deps` of
objc_*, ios__*, and apple_* rules. For those targets, this flag overwrites
`--crosstool_top`.

#### `--compiler={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#compiler}

This option specifies the C/C++ compiler version (such as `gcc-4.1.0`)
to be used for the compilation of binaries during the build. If you want to
build with a custom crosstool, you should use a CROSSTOOL file instead of
specifying this flag.

Note: Only certain combinations of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU are allowed.

#### `--android_sdk={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-sdk}

Deprecated. This shouldn't be directly specified.

This option specifies the Android SDK/platform toolchain
and Android runtime library that will be used to build any Android-related
rule.

The Android SDK will be automatically selected if an `android_sdk_repository`
rule is defined in the WORKSPACE file.

#### `--java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--javabase=({{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }})` {:#javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_javabase={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

### Execution strategy {:#execution-strategy}

These options affect how Bazel will execute the build.
They should not have any significant effect on the output files
generated by the build. Typically their main effect is on the
speed of the build.

#### `--spawn_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#spawn-strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed.

* `standalone` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is
  deprecated. Please use `local` instead.
* `sandboxed` causes commands to be executed inside a sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that all input files, data dependencies and tools are listed as direct
  dependencies in the `srcs`, `data` and `tools` attributes.
  Bazel enables local sandboxing by default, on systems that support sandboxed execution.
* `local` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses.
* `worker` causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.
* `docker` causes commands to be executed inside a docker sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that docker is installed.
* `remote` causes commands to be executed remotely; this is only available if a
  remote executor has been configured separately.

#### `--strategy {{ "<var>" }}mnemonic{{ "</var>" }}={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed, overriding the
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) (and
[--genrule_strategy](#genrule-strategy) with mnemonic
Genrule) on a per-mnemonic basis. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

#### `--strategy_regexp={{ "<var>" }}<filter,filter,...>=<strategy>{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy-regexp}

This option specifies which strategy should be used to execute commands that have descriptions
matching a certain `regex_filter`. See
[--per_file_copt](#per-file-copt) for details on
regex_filter matching. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

The last `regex_filter` that matches the description is used. This option overrides
other flags for specifying strategy.

* Example: `--strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local` means to run actions using
  `local` strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
* Example:
  `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local' --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed`
  runs 'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `sandboxed` strategy, but reversing
  the order runs it with `local`.
* Example: `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local,sandboxed'` runs
  'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `local` strategy and falls back to
  `sandboxed` if it fails.

#### `--genrule_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#genrule-strategy}

This is a deprecated short-hand for `--strategy=Genrule={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}`.

#### `--jobs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` (-j) {:#jobs}

This option, which takes an integer argument, specifies a limit on
the number of jobs that should be executed concurrently during the
execution phase of the build.

Note : The number of concurrent jobs that Bazel will run
is determined not only by the `--jobs` setting, but also
by Bazel's scheduler, which tries to avoid running concurrent jobs
that will use up more resources (RAM or CPU) than are available,
based on some (very crude) estimates of the resource consumption
of each job. The behavior of the scheduler can be controlled by
the `--local_ram_resources` option.

#### `--progress_report_interval={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:progress-report-interval}

Bazel periodically prints a progress report on jobs that are not
finished yet (such as long running tests). This option sets the
reporting frequency, progress will be printed every `n`
seconds.

The default is 0, that means an incremental algorithm: the first
report will be printed after 10 seconds, then 30 seconds and after
that progress is reported once every minute.

When bazel is using cursor control, as specified by
[`--curses`](#curses), progress is reported every second.

#### `--local_{ram,cpu}_resources {{ "<var>" }}resources or resource expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#local-resources}

These options specify the amount of local resources (RAM in MB and number of CPU logical cores)
that Bazel can take into consideration when scheduling build and test activities to run locally. They take
an integer, or a keyword (HOST_RAM or HOST_CPUS) optionally followed by `[-|*`float`]`
(for example, `--local_cpu_resources=2`, `--local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*.5`,
`--local_cpu_resources=HOST_CPUS-1`).
The flags are independent; one or both may be set. By default, Bazel estimates
the amount of RAM and number of CPU cores directly from the local system's configuration.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_links` {:#build-runfile-links}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether the runfiles
symlinks for tests and binaries should be built in the output directory.
Using `--nobuild_runfile_links` can be useful
to validate if all targets compile without incurring the overhead
for building the runfiles trees.

When tests (or applications) are executed, their run-time data
dependencies are gathered together in one place. Within Bazel's
output tree, this "runfiles" tree is typically rooted as a sibling of
the corresponding binary or test.
During test execution, runfiles may be accessed using paths of the form
`$TEST_SRCDIR/{{ "<var>" }}canonical_repo_name{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}packagename{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}filename{{ "</var>" }}`.
The runfiles tree ensures that tests have access to all the files
upon which they have a declared dependence, and nothing more. By
default, the runfiles tree is implemented by constructing a set of
symbolic links to the required files. As the set of links grows, so
does the cost of this operation, and for some large builds it can
contribute significantly to overall build time, particularly because
each individual test (or application) requires its own runfiles tree.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_manifests` {:#build-runfile-manifests}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether runfiles manifests
should be written to the output tree.
Disabling it implies `--nobuild_runfile_links`.

It can be disabled when executing tests remotely, as runfiles trees will
be created remotely from in-memory manifests.

#### `--[no]discard_analysis_cache` {:#discard-analysis-cache}

When this option is enabled, Bazel will discard the analysis cache
right before execution starts, thus freeing up additional memory
(around 10%) for the [execution phase](/run/build#execution).
The drawback is that further incremental builds will be slower. See also
[memory-saving mode](/configure/memory).

#### `--[no]keep_going`  (-k) {:#keep-going}

As in GNU Make, the execution phase of a build stops when the first
error is encountered. Sometimes it is useful to try to build as
much as possible even in the face of errors. This option enables
that behavior, and when it is specified, the build will attempt to
build every target whose prerequisites were successfully built, but
will ignore errors.

While this option is usually associated with the execution phase of
a build, it also affects the analysis phase: if several targets are
specified in a build command, but only some of them can be
successfully analyzed, the build will stop with an error
unless `--keep_going` is specified, in which case the
build will proceed to the execution phase, but only for the targets
that were successfully analyzed.

#### `--[no]use_ijars` {:#use-ijars}

This option changes the way `java_library` targets are
compiled by Bazel. Instead of using the output of a
`java_library` for compiling dependent
`java_library` targets, Bazel will create interface jars
that contain only the signatures of non-private members (public,
protected, and default (package) access methods and fields) and use
the interface jars to compile the dependent targets. This makes it
possible to avoid recompilation when changes are only made to
method bodies or private members of a class.

Note: Using `--use_ijars` might give you a different
error message when you are accidentally referring to a non visible
member of another class: Instead of getting an error that the member
is not visible you will get an error that the member does not exist.
Changing the `--use_ijars` setting will force a recompilation of all affected
classes.

#### `--[no]interface_shared_objects` {:#interface-shared-objects}

This option enables _interface shared objects_, which makes binaries and
other shared libraries depend on the _interface_ of a shared object,
rather than its implementation. When only the implementation changes, Bazel
can avoid rebuilding targets that depend on the changed shared library
unnecessarily.

### Output selection {:#output-selection}

These options determine what to build or test.

#### `--[no]build` {:#build}

This option causes the execution phase of the build to occur; it is
on by default. When it is switched off, the execution phase is
skipped, and only the first two phases, loading and analysis, occur.

This option can be useful for validating BUILD files and detecting
errors in the inputs, without actually building anything.

#### `--[no]build_tests_only` {:#build-tests-only}

If specified, Bazel will build only what is necessary to run the `*_test`
and `test_suite` rules that were not filtered due to their
[size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters).
If specified, Bazel will ignore other targets specified on the command line.
By default, this option is disabled and Bazel will build everything
requested, including `*_test` and `test_suite` rules that are filtered out from
testing. This is useful because running
`bazel test --build_tests_only foo/...` may not detect all build
breakages in the `foo` tree.

#### `--[no]check_up_to_date` {:#check-up-to-date}

This option causes Bazel not to perform a build, but merely check
whether all specified targets are up-to-date. If so, the build
completes successfully, as usual. However, if any files are out of
date, instead of being built, an error is reported and the build
fails. This option may be useful to determine whether a build has
been performed more recently than a source edit (for example, for pre-submit
checks) without incurring the cost of a build.

See also [`--check_tests_up_to_date`](#check-tests-up-to-date).

#### `--[no]compile_one_dependency` {:#compile-one-dependency}

Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This is useful for
syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding a single
target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all
non-flag arguments are interpreted: each argument must be a
file target label or a plain filename relative to the current working
directory, and one rule that depends on each source filename is built. For
C++ and Java
sources, rules in the same language space are preferentially chosen. For
multiple rules with the same preference, the one that appears first in the
BUILD file is chosen. An explicitly named target pattern which does not
reference a source file results in an error.

#### `--save_temps` {:#save-temps}

The `--save_temps` option causes temporary outputs from the compiler to be
saved. These include .s files (assembler code), .i (preprocessed C) and .ii
(preprocessed C++) files. These outputs are often useful for debugging. Temps will only be
generated for the set of targets specified on the command line.

Note: The implementation of `--save_temps` does not use the compiler's
`-save-temps` flag. Instead, there are two passes, one with `-S`
and one with `-E`. A consequence of this is that if your build fails,
Bazel may not yet have produced the ".i" or ".ii" and ".s" files.
If you're trying to use `--save_temps` to debug a failed compilation,
you may need to also use `--keep_going` so that Bazel will still try to
produce the preprocessed files after the compilation fails.

The `--save_temps` flag currently works only for cc_* rules.

To ensure that Bazel prints the location of the additional output files, check that
your [`--show_result {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}`](#show-result)
setting is high enough.

#### `--build_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#build-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will build only targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Build tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

When running tests, Bazel ignores `--build_tag_filters` for test targets,
which are built and run even if they do not match this filter. To avoid building them, filter
test targets using `--test_tag_filters` or by explicitly excluding them.

#### `--test_size_filters={{ "<var>" }}size[,size]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-size-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given size. Test size filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test size values (small,
medium, large or enormous), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test sizes. For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=small,medium //foo:all
</pre>

and

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=-large,-enormous //foo:all
</pre>

will test only small and medium tests inside //foo.

By default, test size filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_timeout_filters={{ "<var>" }}timeout[,timeout]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given timeout. Test timeout filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test timeout values (short,
moderate, long or eternal), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test timeouts. See [--test_size_filters](#test-size-filters)
for example syntax.

By default, test timeout filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Test tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_tag_filters=performance,stress,-flaky //myproject:all
</pre>

will test targets that are tagged with either `performance` or
`stress` tag but are **not** tagged with the `flaky` tag.

By default, test tag filtering is not applied. Note that you can also filter
on test's `size` and `local` tags in
this manner.

#### `--test_lang_filters={{ "<var>" }}string[,string]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-lang-filters}

Specifies a comma-separated list of strings referring to names of test rule
classes. To refer to the rule class `foo_test`, use the string "foo". Bazel will
test (or build if `--build_tests_only` is also specified) only
targets of the referenced rule classes. To instead exclude those targets, use
the string "-foo". For example,

</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=foo,bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test only targets that are instances of `foo_test` or `bar_test` in
  `//baz/...`, while
</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=-foo,-bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test all the targets in `//baz/...` except for the `foo_test` and
  `bar_test` instances.
</p>

Tip: You can use `bazel query --output=label_kind "//p:t"` to
learn the rule class name of the target `//p:t`. And you can
look at the pair of instantiation stacks in the output of
`bazel query --output=build "//p:t"` to learn why that target
is an instance of that rule class.

Warning: The option name "--test_lang_filter" is vestigal and is therefore
unfortunately misleading; don't make assumptions about the semantics based on
the name.

#### `--test_filter={{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-filter}

Specifies a filter that the test runner may use to pick a subset of tests for
running. All targets specified in the invocation are built, but depending on
the expression only some of them may be executed; in some cases, only certain
test methods are run.

The particular interpretation of {{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }} is up to
the test framework responsible for running the test. It may be a glob,
substring, or regexp. `--test_filter` is a convenience
over passing different `--test_arg` filter arguments,
but not all frameworks support it.

### Verbosity {:#verbosity}

These options control the verbosity of Bazel's output,
either to the terminal, or to additional log files.

#### `--explain={{ "<var>" }}logfile{{ "</var>" }}` {:#explain}

This option, which requires a filename argument, causes the
dependency checker in `bazel build`'s execution phase to
explain, for each build step, either why it is being executed, or
that it is up-to-date. The explanation is written
to _logfile_.

If you are encountering unexpected rebuilds, this option can help to
understand the reason. Add it to your `.bazelrc` so that
logging occurs for all subsequent builds, and then inspect the log
when you see an execution step executed unexpectedly. This option
may carry a small performance penalty, so you might want to remove
it when it is no longer needed.

#### `--verbose_explanations` {:#verbose-explanations}

This option increases the verbosity of the explanations generated
when the [--explain](#explain) option is enabled.

In particular, if verbose explanations are enabled,
and an output file is rebuilt because the command used to
build it has changed, then the output in the explanation file will
include the full details of the new command (at least for most
commands).

Using this option may significantly increase the length of the
generated explanation file and the performance penalty of using
`--explain`.

If `--explain` is not enabled, then
`--verbose_explanations` has no effect.

#### `--profile={{ "<var>" }}file{{ "</var>" }}` {:#profile}

This option, which takes a filename argument, causes Bazel to write
profiling data into a file. The data then can be analyzed or parsed using the
`bazel analyze-profile` command. The Build profile can be useful in
understanding where Bazel's `build` command is spending its time.

#### `--[no]show_loading_progress` {:#show-loading-progress}

This option causes Bazel to output package-loading progress
messages. If it is disabled, the messages won't be shown.

#### `--[no]show_progress` {:#show-progress}

This option causes progress messages to be displayed; it is on by
default. When disabled, progress messages are suppressed.

#### `--show_progress_rate_limit={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-progress-rate}

This option causes bazel to display at most one progress message per `n` seconds,
where {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }} is a real number.
The default value for this option is 0.02, meaning bazel will limit the progress
messages to one per every 0.02 seconds.

#### `--show_result={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-result}

This option controls the printing of result information at the end
of a `bazel build` command. By default, if a single
build target was specified, Bazel prints a message stating whether
or not the target was successfully brought up-to-date, and if so,
the list of output files that the target created. If multiple
targets were specified, result information is not displayed.

While the result information may be useful for builds of a single
target or a few targets, for large builds (such as an entire top-level
project tree), this information can be overwhelming and distracting;
this option allows it to be controlled. `--show_result`
takes an integer argument, which is the maximum number of targets
for which full result information should be printed. By default,
the value is 1. Above this threshold, no result information is
shown for individual targets. Thus zero causes the result
information to be suppressed always, and a very large value causes
the result to be printed always.

Users may wish to choose a value in-between if they regularly
alternate between building a small group of targets (for example,
during the compile-edit-test cycle) and a large group of targets
(for example, when establishing a new workspace or running
regression tests). In the former case, the result information is
very useful whereas in the latter case it is less so. As with all
options, this can be specified implicitly via
the [`.bazelrc`](/run/bazelrc) file.

The files are printed so as to make it easy to copy and paste the
filename to the shell, to run built executables. The "up-to-date"
or "failed" messages for each target can be easily parsed by scripts
which drive a build.

#### `--sandbox_debug` {:#sandbox-debug}

This option causes Bazel to print extra debugging information when using sandboxing for action
execution. This option also preserves sandbox directories, so that the files visible to actions
during execution can be examined.

#### `--subcommands` (`-s`) {:#subcommands}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for each command prior to executing it.

<pre>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # //examples/cpp:hello-world [action 'Linking examples/cpp/hello-world']
  (cd /home/johndoe/.cache/bazel/_bazel_johndoe/4c084335afceb392cfbe7c31afee3a9f/bazel && \
    exec env - \
    /usr/bin/gcc -o bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world -B/usr/bin/ -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now -no-canonical-prefixes -pass-exit-codes -Wl,-S -Wl,@bazel-out/local_linux-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world-2.params)
</pre>

Where possible, commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax,
so that they can be easily copied and pasted to a shell command prompt.
(The surrounding parentheses are provided to protect your shell from the
`cd` and `exec` calls; be sure to copy them!)
However some commands are implemented internally within Bazel, such as
creating symlink trees. For these there's no command line to display.

`--subcommands=pretty_print` may be passed to print
the arguments of the command as a list rather than as a single line. This may
help make long command lines more readable.

See also [--verbose_failures](#verbose-failures), below.

For logging subcommands to a file in a tool-friendly format, see
[--execution_log_json_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_json_file)
and
[--execution_log_binary_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_binary_file).

#### `--verbose_failures` {:#verbose-failures}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for commands that failed. This can be invaluable for debugging a
failing build.

Failing commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax, suitable
for copying and pasting to a shell prompt.

### Workspace status {:#workspace-status}

Use these options to "stamp" Bazel-built binaries: to embed additional information into the
binaries, such as the source control revision or other workspace-related information. You can use
this mechanism with rules that support the `stamp` attribute, such as
`genrule`, `cc_binary`, and more.

#### `--workspace_status_command={{ "<var>" }}program{{ "</var>" }}` {:#workspace-status-command}

This flag lets you specify a binary that Bazel runs before each build. The program can report
information about the status of the workspace, such as the current source control revision.

The flag's value must be a path to a native program. On Linux/macOS this may be any executable.
On Windows this must be a native binary, typically an ".exe", ".bat", or a ".cmd" file.

The program should print zero or more key/value pairs to standard output, one entry on each line,
then exit with zero (otherwise the build fails). The key names can be anything but they may only
use upper case letters and underscores. The first space after the key name separates it from the
value. The value is the rest of the line (including additional whitespaces). Neither the key nor
the value may span multiple lines. Keys must not be duplicated.

Bazel partitions the keys into two buckets: "stable" and "volatile". (The names "stable" and
"volatile" are a bit counter-intuitive, so don't think much about them.)

Bazel then writes the key-value pairs into two files:

*   `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
    contains all keys and values where the key's name starts with `STABLE_`
*   `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
    contains the rest of the keys and their values

The contract is:

*   "stable" keys' values should change rarely, if possible. If the contents of
    `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
      change, Bazel invalidates the actions that depend on them. In
      other words, if a stable key's value changes, Bazel will rerun stamped actions.
      Therefore the stable status should not contain things like timestamps, because they change all
      the time, and would make Bazel rerun stamped actions with each build.

    Bazel always outputs the following stable keys:
    *   `BUILD_EMBED_LABEL`: value of `--embed_label`
    *   `BUILD_HOST`: the name of the host machine that Bazel is running on
    *   `BUILD_USER`: the name of the user that Bazel is running as
*   "volatile" keys' values may change often. Bazel expects them to change all the time, like
      timestamps do, and duly updates the
    `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
      file. In order to avoid
      rerunning stamped actions all the time though, **Bazel pretends that the volatile file never
      changes**. In other words, if the volatile status file is the only file whose contents has
      changed, Bazel will not invalidate actions that depend on it. If other inputs of the actions
      have changed, then Bazel reruns that action, and the action will see the updated volatile
      status, but just the volatile status changing alone will not invalidate the action.

    Bazel always outputs the following volatile keys:
      *   `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: time of the build in seconds since the Unix Epoch (the value
        of `System.currentTimeMillis()` divided by a thousand)
      *   `FORMATTED_DATE`: time of the build Formatted as
        `yyyy MMM d HH mm ss EEE`(for example 2023 Jun 2 01 44 29 Fri) in UTC.

On Linux/macOS you can pass `--workspace_status_command=/bin/true` to
disable retrieving workspace status, because `true` does nothing, successfully (exits
with zero) and prints no output. On Windows you can pass the path of MSYS's `true.exe`
for the same effect.

If the workspace status command fails (exits non-zero) for any reason, the build will fail.

Example program on Linux using Git:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo "CURRENT_TIME $(date +%s)"
echo "RANDOM_HASH $(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
echo "STABLE_GIT_COMMIT $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
echo "STABLE_USER_NAME $USER"
</pre>

Pass this program's path with `--workspace_status_command`, and the stable status file
will include the STABLE lines and the volatile status file will include the rest of the lines.

#### `--[no]stamp` {:#stamp}

This option, in conjunction with the `stamp` rule attribute, controls whether to
embed build information in binaries.

Stamping can be enabled or disabled explicitly on a per-rule basis using the
`stamp` attribute. Please refer to the Build Encyclopedia for details. When
a rule sets `stamp = -1` (the default for `*_binary` rules), this option
determines whether stamping is enabled.

Bazel never stamps binaries that are built for the exec configuration,
regardless of this option or the `stamp` attribute. For rules that set `stamp =
0` (the default for `*_test` rules), stamping is disabled regardless of
`--[no]stamp`. Specifying `--stamp` does not force targets to be rebuilt if
their dependencies have not changed.

Setting `--nostamp` is generally desireable for build performance, as it
reduces input volatility and maximizes build caching.

### Platform {:#platform}

Use these options to control the host and target platforms that configure how builds work, and to
control what execution platforms and toolchains are available to Bazel rules.

Please see background information on [Platforms](/extending/platforms) and [Toolchains](/extending/toolchains).

#### `--platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platforms}

The labels of the platform rules describing the target platforms for the
current command.

#### `--host_platform={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-platform}

The label of a platform rule that describes the host system.

#### `--extra_execution_platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-execution-platforms}

The platforms that are available as execution platforms to run actions.
Platforms can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These
platforms will be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_execution_platforms()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_execution_platforms).
This option accepts a comma-separated list of platforms in order of priority.
If the flag is passed multiple times, the most recent overrides.

#### `--extra_toolchains={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-toolchains}

The toolchain rules to be considered during toolchain resolution. Toolchains
can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These toolchains will
be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_toolchains()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_toolchains).

#### `--toolchain_resolution_debug={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#toolchain-resolution-debug}

Print debug information while finding toolchains if the toolchain type matches
the regex. Multiple regexes can be separated by commas. The regex can be
negated by using a `-` at the beginning. This might help developers
of Bazel or Starlark rules with debugging failures due to missing toolchains.

### Miscellaneous {:#miscellaneous}

#### `--flag_alias={{ "<var>" }}alias_name=target_path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flag-alias}

A convenience flag used to bind longer Starlark build settings to a shorter name. For more
details, see the
[Starlark Configurations](/extending/config#using-build-setting-aliases).

#### `--symlink_prefix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#symlink-prefix}

Changes the prefix of the generated convenience symlinks. The
default value for the symlink prefix is `bazel-` which
will create the symlinks `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`, and
`bazel-genfiles`.

If the symbolic links cannot be created for any reason, a warning is
issued but the build is still considered a success. In particular,
this allows you to build in a read-only directory or one that you have no
permission to write into. Any paths printed in informational
messages at the conclusion of a build will only use the
symlink-relative short form if the symlinks point to the expected
location; in other words, you can rely on the correctness of those
paths, even if you cannot rely on the symlinks being created.

Some common values of this option:

*   **Suppress symlink creation:**
      `--symlink_prefix=/` will cause Bazel to not
      create or update any symlinks, including the `bazel-out` and
      `bazel-<workspace>`
      symlinks. Use this option to suppress symlink creation entirely.

*   **Reduce clutter:**
      `--symlink_prefix=.bazel/` will cause Bazel to create
      symlinks called `bin` (etc) inside a hidden directory `.bazel`.

#### `--platform_suffix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platform-suffix}

Adds a suffix to the configuration short name, which is used to determine the
output directory. Setting this option to different values puts the files into
different directories, for example to improve cache hit rates for builds that
otherwise clobber each others output files, or to keep the output files around
for comparisons.

#### `--default_visibility={{ "<var>" }}(private|public){{ "</var>" }}` {:#default-visibility}

Temporary flag for testing bazel default visibility changes. Not intended for general use
but documented for completeness' sake.

#### `--starlark_cpu_profile=_file_` {:#starlark-cpu-profile}

This flag, whose value is the name of a file, causes Bazel to gather
statistics about CPU usage by all Starlark threads,
and write the profile, in [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof){: .external} format,
to the named file.

Use this option to help identify Starlark functions that
make loading and analysis slow due to excessive computation. For example:

<pre>
$ bazel build --nobuild --starlark_cpu_profile=/tmp/pprof.gz my/project/...
$ pprof /tmp/pprof.gz
(pprof) top

`web`, and `list`.

## Using Bazel for releases {:#bazel-for-releases}

Bazel is used both by software engineers during the development
cycle, and by release engineers when preparing binaries for deployment
to production. This section provides a list of tips for release
engineers using Bazel.

### Significant options {:#significant-options}

When using Bazel for release builds, the same issues arise as for other scripts
that perform a build. For more details, see
[Call Bazel from scripts](/run/scripts). In particular, the following options
are strongly recommended:

*   [`--bazelrc=/dev/null`](/run/bazelrc)
*   [`--nokeep_state_after_build`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--keep_state_after_build)

These options are also important:

*   [`--package_path`](#package-path)
*   [`--symlink_prefix`](#symlink-prefix):
    for managing builds for multiple configurations,
    it may be convenient to distinguish each build
    with a distinct identifier, such as "64bit" vs. "32bit". This option
    differentiates the `bazel-bin` (etc.) symlinks.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To build and run tests with bazel, type `bazel test` followed by
the name of the test targets.

By default, this command performs simultaneous build and test
activity, building all specified targets (including any non-test
targets specified on the command line) and testing
`*_test` and `test_suite` targets as soon as
their prerequisites are built, meaning that test execution is
interleaved with building. Doing so usually results in significant
speed gains.

### Options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-options}

#### `--cache_test_results=(yes|no|auto)` (`-t`) {:#cache-test-results}

If this option is set to 'auto' (the default) then Bazel will only rerun a test if any of the
following conditions applies:

*   Bazel detects changes in the test or its dependencies
*   the test is marked as `external`
*   multiple test runs were requested with `--runs_per_test`
*   the test failed.

If 'no', all tests will be executed unconditionally.

If 'yes', the caching behavior will be the same as auto
except that it may cache test failures and test runs with
`--runs_per_test`.

Note: Test results are _always_ saved in Bazel's output tree,
regardless of whether this option is enabled, so
you needn't have used `--cache_test_results` on the
prior run(s) of `bazel test` in order to get cache hits.
The option only affects whether Bazel will _use_ previously
saved results, not whether it will save results of the current run.

Users who have enabled this option by default in
their `.bazelrc` file may find the
abbreviations `-t` (on) or `-t-` (off)
convenient for overriding the default on a particular run.

#### `--check_tests_up_to_date` {:#check-tests-up-to-date}

This option tells Bazel not to run the tests, but to merely check and report
the cached test results. If there are any tests which have not been
previously built and run, or whose tests results are out-of-date (for example, because
the source code or the build options have changed), then Bazel will report
an error message ("test result is not up-to-date"), will record the test's
status as "NO STATUS" (in red, if color output is enabled), and will return
a non-zero exit code.

This option also implies
[`--check_up_to_date`](#check-up-to-date) behavior.

This option may be useful for pre-submit checks.

#### `--test_verbose_timeout_warnings` {:#test-verbose-timeout-warnings}

This option tells Bazel to explicitly warn the user if a test's timeout is
significantly longer than the test's actual execution time. While a test's
timeout should be set such that it is not flaky, a test that has a highly
over-generous timeout can hide real problems that crop up unexpectedly.

For instance, a test that normally executes in a minute or two should not have
a timeout of ETERNAL or LONG as these are much, much too generous.

This option is useful to help users decide on a good timeout value or
sanity check existing timeout values.

Note: Each test shard is allotted the timeout of the entire
`XX_test` target. Using this option does not affect a test's timeout
value, merely warns if Bazel thinks the timeout could be restricted further.

#### `--[no]test_keep_going` {:#test-keep-going}

By default, all tests are run to completion. If this flag is disabled,
however, the build is aborted on any non-passing test. Subsequent build steps
and test invocations are not run, and in-flight invocations are canceled.
Do not specify both `--notest_keep_going` and `--keep_going`.

#### `--flaky_test_attempts={{ "<var>" }}attempts{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flaky-test-attempts}

This option specifies the maximum number of times a test should be attempted
if it fails for any reason. A test that initially fails but eventually
succeeds is reported as `FLAKY` on the test summary. It is,
however, considered to be passed when it comes to identifying Bazel exit code
or total number of passed tests. Tests that fail all allowed attempts are
considered to be failed.

By default (when this option is not specified, or when it is set to
default), only a single attempt is allowed for regular tests, and
3 for test rules with the `flaky` attribute set. You can specify
an integer value to override the maximum limit of test attempts. Bazel allows
a maximum of 10 test attempts in order to prevent abuse of the system.

#### `--runs_per_test={{ "<var>" }}[regex@]number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#runs-per-test}

This option specifies the number of times each test should be executed. All
test executions are treated as separate tests (fallback functionality
will apply to each of them independently).

The status of a target with failing runs depends on the value of the
`--runs_per_test_detects_flakes` flag:

*  If absent, any failing run causes the entire test to fail.
*  If present and two runs from the same shard return PASS and FAIL, the test
   will receive a status of flaky (unless other failing runs cause it to
   fail).

If a single number is specified, all tests will run that many times.
Alternatively, a regular expression may be specified using the syntax
regex@number. This constrains the effect of `--runs_per_test` to targets
which match the regex (`--runs_per_test=^//pizza:.*@4` runs all tests
under `//pizza/` 4 times).
This form of `--runs_per_test` may be specified more than once.

#### `--[no]runs_per_test_detects_flakes` {:#run-per-test-detects-flakes}

If this option is specified (by default it is not), Bazel will detect flaky
test shards through `--runs_per_test`. If one or more runs for a single shard
fail and one or more runs for the same shard pass, the target will be
considered flaky with the flag. If unspecified, the target will report a
failing status.

#### `--test_summary={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-summary}

Specifies how the test result summary should be displayed.

*   `short` prints the results of each test along with the name of
    the file containing the test output if the test failed. This is the default
    value.
*   `terse` like `short`, but even shorter: only print
    information about tests which did not pass.
*   `detailed` prints each individual test case that failed, not
    only each test. The names of test output files are omitted.
*   `none` does not print test summary.

#### `--test_output={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-output}

Specifies how test output should be displayed:

*   `summary` shows a summary of whether each test passed or
    failed. Also shows the output log file name for failed tests. The summary
    will be printed at the end of the build (during the build, one would see
    just simple progress messages when tests start, pass or fail).
    This is the default behavior.
*   `errors` sends combined stdout/stderr output from failed tests
    only into the stdout immediately after test is completed, ensuring that
    test output from simultaneous tests is not interleaved with each other.
    Prints a summary at the build as per summary output above.
*   `all` is similar to `errors` but prints output for
    all tests, including those which passed.
*   `streamed` streams stdout/stderr output from each test in
    real-time.

#### `--java_debug` {:#java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine of a java test to wait for a connection from a
JDWP-compliant debugger before starting the test. This option implies `--test_output=streamed`.

#### `--[no]verbose_test_summary` {:#verbose-test-summary}

By default this option is enabled, causing test times and other additional
information (such as test attempts) to be printed to the test summary. If
`--noverbose_test_summary` is specified, test summary will
include only test name, test status and cached test indicator and will
be formatted to stay within 80 characters when possible.

#### `--test_tmpdir={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tmpdir}

Specifies temporary directory for tests executed locally. Each test will be
executed in a separate subdirectory inside this directory. The directory will
be cleaned at the beginning of the each `bazel test` command.
By default, bazel will place this directory under Bazel output base directory.

Note: This is a directory for running tests, not storing test results
(those are always stored under the `bazel-out` directory).

#### `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` OR `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout}

Overrides the timeout value for all tests by using specified number of
seconds as a new timeout value. If only one value is provided, then it will
be used for all test timeout categories.

Alternatively, four comma-separated values may be provided, specifying
individual timeouts for short, moderate, long and eternal tests (in that
order).
In either form, zero or a negative value for any of the test sizes will
be substituted by the default timeout for the given timeout categories as
defined by the page [Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia).
By default, Bazel will use these timeouts for all tests by
inferring the timeout limit from the test's size whether the size is
implicitly or explicitly set.

Tests which explicitly state their timeout category as distinct from their
size will receive the same value as if that timeout had been implicitly set by
the size tag. So a test of size 'small' which declares a 'long' timeout will
have the same effective timeout that a 'large' tests has with no explicit
timeout.

#### `--test_arg={{ "<var>" }}arg{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-arg}

Passes command-line options/flags/arguments to each test process. This
option can be used multiple times to pass several arguments. For example,
`--test_arg=--logtostderr --test_arg=--v=3`.

Note that, unlike the `bazel run` command, you can't pass test arguments
directly as in `bazel test -- target --logtostderr --v=3`. That's because
extraneous arguments passed to `bazel test` are interpreted as additional test
targets. That is, `--logtostderr` and `--v=3` would each be interpreted as a
test target. This ambiguity doesn't exist for a `bazel run` command, which only
accepts one target.

`--test_arg` can be passed to a `bazel run` command, but it's ignored unless the
target being run is a test target. (As with any other flag, if it's passed in a
`bazel run` command after a `--` token, it's not processed by Bazel but
forwarded verbatim to the executed target.)

#### `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}=_value_` OR `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-env}

Specifies additional variables that must be injected into the test
environment for each test. If {{ "<var>" }}value{{ "</var>" }} is not specified it will be
inherited from the shell environment used to start the `bazel test`
command.

The environment can be accessed from within a test by using
`System.getenv("var")` (Java), `getenv("var")` (C or C++),

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-run-under}

This specifies a prefix that the test runner will insert in front
of the test command before running it. The
{{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }} is split into words using Bourne shell
tokenization rules, and then the list of words is prepended to the
command that will be executed.

If the first word is a fully-qualified label (starts with
`//`) it is built. Then the label is substituted by the
corresponding executable location that is prepended to the command
that will be executed along with the other words.

Some caveats apply:

*   The PATH used for running tests may be different than the PATH in your environment,
    so you may need to use an **absolute path** for the `--run_under`
    command (the first word in {{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}).
*   **`stdin` is not connected**, so `--run_under`
    can't be used for interactive commands.

Examples:

<pre>
        --run_under=/usr/bin/strace
        --run_under='/usr/bin/strace -c'
        --run_under=/usr/bin/valgrind
        --run_under='/usr/bin/valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20'
</pre>

#### Test selection {:#test-selection}

As documented under [Output selection options](#output-selection),
you can filter tests by [size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters). A convenience
[general name filter](#test-filter) can forward particular
filter args to the test runner.

#### Other options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-other-options}

The syntax and the remaining options are exactly like
[`bazel build`](/run/build).

## Running executables {:#running-executables}

The `bazel run` command is similar to `bazel build`, except
it is used to build _and run_ a single target. Here is a typical session
(`//java/myapp:myapp` says hello and prints out its args):

<pre>
  % bazel run java/myapp:myapp -- --arg1 --arg2
  INFO: Analyzed target //java/myapp:myapp (13 packages loaded, 27 targets configured).
  INFO: Found 1 target...
  Target //java/myapp:myapp up-to-date:
    bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp
  INFO: Elapsed time: 14.290s, Critical Path: 5.54s, ...
  INFO: Build completed successfully, 4 total actions
  INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp &lt;args omitted&gt;
  Hello there
  $EXEC_ROOT/java/myapp/myapp
  --arg1
  --arg2
</pre>

Note: `--` is needed so that Bazel
does not interpret `--arg1` and `--arg2` as
Bazel options, but rather as part of the command line for running the binary.
Additionally, Bazel will avoid logging these arguments to the console in case
they contain sensitive information.

`bazel run` is similar, but not identical, to directly invoking
the binary built by Bazel and its behavior is different depending on whether the
binary to be invoked is a test or not.

When the binary is not a test, the current working directory will be the
runfiles tree of the binary.

When the binary is a test, the current working directory will be the exec root
and a good-faith attempt is made to replicate the environment tests are usually
run in. The emulation is not perfect, though, and tests that have multiple
shards cannot be run this way (the
`--test_sharding_strategy=disabled` command line option can be used
to work around this)

The following extra environment variables are also available to the binary:

*   `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`: the root of the workspace where the
    build was run.
*   `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY`: the current working directory where
    Bazel was run from.
*   `BUILD_ID`: the build ID of the `bazel run` invocation. This is usually
    unique, except if Bazel was run with `--script_path` and the resulting
    script is re-used.
*   `BUILD_EXECROOT`: the execution root of the `bazel run` invocation.

These can be used, for example, to interpret file names on the command line in
a user-friendly way.

### Options for `bazel run` {:#bazel-run-options}

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#run-run-under}

This has the same effect as the `--run_under` option for
`bazel test` ([see above](#test-run-under)),
except that it applies to the command being run by `bazel
run` rather than to the tests being run by `bazel test`
and cannot run under label.

#### Filtering logging outputs from Bazel

When invoking a binary with `bazel run`, Bazel prints logging output from Bazel
itself and the binary under invocation. To make the logs less noisy, you can
suppress the outputs from Bazel itself with the `--ui_event_filters` and
`--noshow_progress` flags.

For example:
`bazel run --ui_event_filters=-info,-stdout,-stderr --noshow_progress //java/myapp:myapp`

### Executing tests {:#executing-tests}

`bazel run` can also execute test binaries, which has the effect of
running the test in a close approximation of the environment described at
[Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia). Note that none of the
`--test_*` arguments have an effect when running a test in this manner except
`--test_arg` .

## Cleaning build outputs {:#cleaning-build-outputs}

### The `clean` command {:#clean}

Bazel has a `clean` command, analogous to that of Make.
It deletes the output directories for all build configurations performed
by this Bazel instance, or the entire working tree created by this
Bazel instance, and resets internal caches. If executed without any
command-line options, then the output directory for all configurations
will be cleaned.

Recall that each Bazel instance is associated with a single workspace, thus the
`clean` command will delete all outputs from all builds you've done
with that Bazel instance in that workspace.

To completely remove the entire working tree created by a Bazel
instance,  you can specify the `--expunge` option. When
executed with `--expunge`, the clean command simply
removes the entire output base tree which, in addition to the build
output, contains all temp files created by Bazel. It also
stops the Bazel server after the clean, equivalent to the [`shutdown`](#shutdown) command. For example, to
clean up all disk and memory traces of a Bazel instance, you could
specify:

<pre>
  % bazel clean --expunge
</pre>

Alternatively, you can expunge in the background by using
`--expunge_async`. It is safe to invoke a Bazel command
in the same client while the asynchronous expunge continues to run.

Note: This may introduce IO contention.

The `clean` command is provided primarily as a means of
reclaiming disk space for workspaces that are no longer needed.
Bazel's incremental rebuilds may not be
perfect so `clean` can be used to recover a consistent
state when problems arise.

Bazel's design is such that these problems are fixable and
these bugs are a high priority to be fixed. If you
ever find an incorrect incremental build, file a bug report, and report bugs in the tools
rather than using `clean`.

## Querying the dependency graph {:#querying-dependency-graph}

Bazel includes a query language for asking questions about the
dependency graph used during the build. The query language is used
by two commands: query and cquery. The major difference between the
two commands is that query runs after the [loading phase](/run/build#loading)
and cquery runs after the [analysis phase](/run/build#analysis). These tools are an
invaluable aid to many software engineering tasks.

The query language is based on the idea of
algebraic operations over graphs; it is documented in detail in

[Bazel Query Reference](/query/language).
Please refer to that document for reference, for
examples, and for query-specific command-line options.

The query tool accepts several command-line
option. `--output` selects the output format.
`--[no]keep_going` (disabled by default) causes the query
tool to continue to make progress upon errors; this behavior may be
disabled if an incomplete result is not acceptable in case of errors.

The `--[no]tool_deps` option,
enabled by default, causes dependencies in non-target configurations to be included in the
dependency graph over which the query operates.

The `--[no]implicit_deps` option, enabled by default, causes
implicit dependencies to be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An
implicit dependency is one that is not explicitly specified in the BUILD file
but added by bazel.

Example: "Show the locations of the definitions (in BUILD files) of
all genrules required to build all the tests in the PEBL tree."

<pre>
  bazel query --output location 'kind(genrule, deps(kind(".*_test rule", foo/bar/pebl/...)))'
</pre>

## Querying the action graph {:#aquery}

Caution: The aquery command is still experimental and its API will change.

The `aquery` command allows you to query for actions in your build graph.
It operates on the post-analysis configured target graph and exposes
information about actions, artifacts and their relationships.

The tool accepts several command-line options.
`--output` selects the output format. The default output format
(`text`) is human-readable, use `proto` or `textproto` for
machine-readable format.
Notably, the aquery command runs on top of a regular Bazel build and inherits
the set of options available during a build.

It supports the same set of functions that is also available to traditional
`query` but `siblings`, `buildfiles` and
`tests`.

For more details, see [Action Graph Query](/query/aquery).

## Miscellaneous commands and options {:#misc-commands-options}

### `help` {:#help}

The `help` command provides on-line help. By default, it
shows a summary of available commands and help topics, as shown in
[Building with Bazel](/run/build#quickstart).
Specifying an argument displays detailed help for a particular
topic. Most topics are Bazel commands, such as `build`
or `query`, but there are some additional help topics
that do not correspond to commands.

#### `--[no]long` (`-l`) {:#long}

By default, `bazel help [{{ "<var>" }}topic{{ "</var>" }}]` prints only a
summary of the relevant options for a topic. If
the `--long` option is specified, the type, default value
and full description of each option is also printed.

### `shutdown` {:#shutdown}

Bazel server processes may be stopped by using the `shutdown`
command. This command causes the Bazel server to exit as soon as it
becomes idle (for example, after the completion of any builds or other
commands that are currently in progress). For more details, see
[Client/server implementation](/run/client-server).

Bazel servers stop themselves after an idle timeout, so this command
is rarely necessary; however, it can be useful in scripts when it is
known that no further builds will occur in a given workspace.

`shutdown` accepts one
option, `--iff_heap_size_greater_than _n_`, which
requires an integer argument (in MB). If specified, this makes the shutdown
conditional on the amount of memory already consumed. This is
useful for scripts that initiate a lot of builds, as any memory
leaks in the Bazel server could cause it to crash spuriously on
occasion; performing a conditional restart preempts this condition.

### `info` {:#info}

The `info` command prints various values associated with
the Bazel server instance, or with a specific build configuration.
(These may be used by scripts that drive a build.)

The `info` command also permits a single (optional)
argument, which is the name of one of the keys in the list below.
In this case, `bazel info {{ "<var>" }}key{{ "</var>" }}` will print only
the value for that one key. (This is especially convenient when
scripting Bazel, as it avoids the need to pipe the result
through `sed -ne /key:/s/key://p`:

#### Configuration-independent data {:#configuration-independent-data}

*   `release`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary.
*   `workspace` the absolute path to the base workspace
    directory.
*   `install_base`: the absolute path to the installation
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user. Bazel
    installs its internally required executables below this directory.

*   `output_base`: the absolute path to the base output
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user and
    workspace combination. Bazel puts all of its scratch and build
    output below this directory.
*   `execution_root`: the absolute path to the execution
    root directory under output_base. This directory is the root for all files
    accessible to commands executed during the build, and is the working
    directory for those commands. If the workspace directory is writable, a
    symlink named `bazel-<workspace>`
    is placed there pointing to this directory.
*   `output_path`: the absolute path to the output
    directory beneath the execution root used for all files actually
    generated as a result of build commands. If the workspace directory is
    writable, a symlink named `bazel-out` is placed there pointing
    to this directory.
*   `server_pid`: the process ID of the Bazel server
     process.
*   `server_log`: the absolute path to the Bazel server's debug log file.
    This file contains debugging information for all commands over the lifetime of the
    Bazel server, and is intended for human consumption by Bazel developers and power users.
*   `command_log`: the absolute path to the command log file;
    this contains the interleaved stdout and stderr streams of the most recent
    Bazel command. Note that running `bazel info` will overwrite the
    contents of this file, since it then becomes the most recent Bazel command.
    However, the location of the command log file will not change unless you
    change the setting of the `--output_base` or
    `--output_user_root` options.
*   `used-heap-size`,
      `committed-heap-size`,
      `max-heap-size`: reports various JVM heap size
    parameters. Respectively: memory currently used, memory currently
    guaranteed to be available to the JVM from the system, maximum
    possible allocation.
*   `gc-count`, `gc-time`: The cumulative count of
    garbage collections since the start of this Bazel server and the time spent
    to perform them. Note that these values are not reset at the start of every
    build.
*   `package_path`: A colon-separated list of paths which would be
    searched for packages by bazel. Has the same format as the
    `--package_path` build command line argument.

Example: the process ID of the Bazel server.

<pre>% bazel info server_pid
1285
</pre>

#### Configuration-specific data {:#configuration-specific-data}

These data may be affected by the configuration options passed
to `bazel info`, for
example `--cpu`, `--compilation_mode`,
etc. The `info` command accepts all
the options that control dependency
analysis, since some of these determine the location of the
output directory of a build, the choice of compiler, etc.

*   `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`,
    `bazel-genfiles`: reports the absolute path to
    the `bazel-*` directories in which programs generated by the
    build are located. This is usually, though not always, the same as
    the `bazel-*` symlinks created in the base workspace directory after a
    successful build. However, if the workspace directory is read-only,
    no `bazel-*` symlinks can be created. Scripts that use
    the value reported by `bazel info`, instead of assuming the
    existence of the symlink, will be more robust.
*   The complete
    ["Make" environment](/reference/be/make-variables). If the `--show_make_env` flag is
    specified, all variables in the current configuration's "Make" environment
    are also displayed (such as `CC`, `GLIBC_VERSION`, etc).
    These are the variables accessed using the `$(CC)`
    or `varref("CC")` syntax inside BUILD files.

Example: the C++ compiler for the current configuration.
This is the `$(CC)` variable in the "Make" environment,
so the `--show_make_env` flag is needed.

<pre>
  % bazel info --show_make_env -c opt COMPILATION_MODE
  opt
</pre>

Example: the `bazel-bin` output directory for the current
configuration. This is guaranteed to be correct even in cases where
the `bazel-bin` symlink cannot be created for some reason
(such as if you are building from a read-only directory).

<pre>% bazel info --cpu=piii bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/piii-opt/bin
% bazel info --cpu=k8 bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/k8-opt/bin
</pre>

### `version` and `--version` {:#version}

The version command prints version details about the built Bazel
binary, including the changelist at which it was built and the date.
These are particularly useful in determining if you have the latest
Bazel, or if you are reporting bugs. Some of the interesting values
are:

*   `changelist`: the changelist at which this version of
    Bazel was released.
*   `label`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary. Very useful when reporting bugs.

`bazel --version`, with no other args, will emit the same output as
`bazel version --gnu_format`, except without the side-effect of potentially starting
a Bazel server or unpacking the server archive. `bazel --version` can be run from
anywhere - it does not require a workspace directory.

### `mobile-install` {:#mobile-install}

The `mobile-install` command installs apps to mobile devices.
Currently only Android devices running ART are supported.

See [bazel mobile-install](/docs/mobile-install) for more information.

Note: This command does not install the same thing that
`bazel build` produces: Bazel tweaks the app so that it can be
built, installed and re-installed quickly. This should, however, be mostly
transparent to the app.

The following options are supported:

#### `--incremental` {:#incremental}

If set, Bazel tries to install the app incrementally, that is, only those
parts that have changed since the last build. This cannot update resources
referenced from `AndroidManifest.xml`, native code or Java
resources (such as those referenced by `Class.getResource()`). If these
things change, this option must be omitted. Contrary to the spirit of Bazel
and due to limitations of the Android platform, it is the
**responsibility of the user** to know when this command is good enough and
when a full install is needed.

If you are using a device with Marshmallow or later, consider the
[`--split_apks`](#split-apks) flag.

#### `--split_apks` {:#split-apks}

Whether to use split apks to install and update the application on the device.
Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later. Note that the
[`--incremental`](#incremental) flag
is not necessary when using `--split_apks`.

#### `--start_app` {:#start-app}

Starts the app in a clean state after installing. Equivalent to `--start=COLD`.

#### `--debug_app` {:#debug-app}

Waits for debugger to be attached before starting the app in a clean state after installing.
Equivalent to `--start=DEBUG`.

#### `--start=_start_type_` {:#start}

How the app should be started after installing it. Supported _start_type_s are:

*   `NO` Does not start the app. This is the default.
*   `COLD` Starts the app from a clean state after install.
*   `WARM` Preserves and restores the application state on incremental installs.
*   `DEBUG` Waits for the debugger before starting the app in a clean state after
    install.

Note: If more than one of `--start=_start_type_`, `--start_app` or
`--debug_app` is set, the last value is used.

#### `--adb={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb}

Indicates the `adb` binary to be used.

The default is to use the adb in the Android SDK specified by
[`--android_sdk`](#android-sdk).

#### `--adb_arg={{ "<var>" }}serial{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb-arg}

Extra arguments to `adb`. These come before the subcommand in the
command line and are typically used to specify which device to install to.
For example, to select the Android device or emulator to use:

<pre>% bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=deadbeef
</pre>

invokes `adb` as

<pre>
adb -s deadbeef install ...
</pre>

#### `--incremental_install_verbosity={{ "<var>" }}number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#incremental-install-verbosity}

The verbosity for incremental install. Set to 1 for debug logging to be
printed to the console.

### `dump` {:#dump}

The `dump` command prints to stdout a dump of the
internal state of the Bazel server. This command is intended
primarily for use by Bazel developers, so the output of this command
is not specified, and is subject to change.

By default, command will just print help message outlining possible
options to dump specific areas of the Bazel state. In order to dump
internal state, at least one of the options must be specified.

Following options are supported:

*   `--action_cache` dumps action cache content.
*   `--packages` dumps package cache content.
*   `--skyframe` dumps state of internal Bazel dependency graph.
*   `--rules` dumps rule summary for each rule and aspect class,
    including counts and action counts. This includes both native and Starlark rules.
    If memory tracking is enabled, then the rules' memory consumption is also printed.
*   `--skylark_memory` dumps a
    [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) compatible .gz file to the specified path.
    You must enable memory tracking for this to work.

#### Memory tracking {:#memory-tracking}

Some `dump` commands require memory tracking. To turn this on, you have to pass
startup flags to Bazel:

*   `--host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`
*   `--host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1`

The java-agent is checked into Bazel at
`third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`, so
make sure you adjust `$BAZEL` for where you keep your Bazel repository.

Do not forget to keep passing these options to Bazel for every command or the server will
restart.

Example:

<pre>
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    build --nobuild &lt;targets&gt;

    # Dump rules
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --rules

    # Dump Starlark heap and analyze it with pprof
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --skylark_memory=$HOME/prof.gz
    % pprof -flame $HOME/prof.gz
</pre>

### `analyze-profile` {:#analyze-profile}

The `analyze-profile` command analyzes a
[JSON trace profile](/advanced/performance/json-trace-profile) previously
gathered during a Bazel invocation.

### `canonicalize-flags` {:#canonicalize-flags}

The [`canonicalize-flags`](/reference/command-line-reference#canonicalize-flags-options)
command, which takes a list of options for a Bazel command and returns a list of
options that has the same effect. The new list of options is canonical. For example,
two lists of options with the same effect are canonicalized to the same new list.

The `--for_command` option can be used to select between different
commands. At this time, only `build` and `test` are
supported. Options that the given command does not support cause an error.

Note: A small number of options cannot be reordered, because Bazel cannot
ensure that the effect is identical. Also note that this command
_does not_ expand flags from `--config`.

As an example:

<pre>
  % bazel canonicalize-flags -- --config=any_name --test_tag_filters="-lint"
  --config=any_name
  --test_tag_filters=-lint
</pre>

### Startup options {:#startup-options}

The options described in this section affect the startup of the Java
virtual machine used by Bazel server process, and they apply to all
subsequent commands handled by that server. If there is an already
running Bazel server and the startup options do not match, it will
be restarted.

All of the options described in this section must be specified using the
`--key=value` or `--key value`
syntax. Also, these options must appear _before_ the name of the Bazel
command. Use `startup --key=value` to list these in a `.bazelrc` file.

#### `--output_base={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-base}

This option requires a path argument, which must specify a
writable directory. Bazel will use this location to write all its
output. The output base is also the key by which the client locates
the Bazel server. By changing the output base, you change the server
which will handle the command.

By default, the output base is derived from the user's login name,
and the name of the workspace directory (actually, its MD5 digest),
so a typical value looks like:
`/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`.

Note: The client uses the output base to find the Bazel server
instance, so if you specify a different output base in a Bazel
command, a different server will be found (or started) to handle the
request. It's possible to perform two concurrent builds in the same
workspace directory by varying the output base.

For example:

<pre>
 OUTPUT_BASE=/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/custom_output_base
% bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}1 build //foo  &amp;  bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}2 build //bar
</pre>

In this command, the two Bazel commands run concurrently (because of
the shell `&amp;` operator), each using a different Bazel
server instance (because of the different output bases).
In contrast, if the default output base was used in both commands,
then both requests would be sent to the same server, which would
handle them sequentially: building `//foo` first, followed
by an incremental build of `//bar`.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--output_user_root={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-user-root}

Points to the root directory where output and install bases are created. The directory
must either not exist or be owned by the calling user. In the past,
this was allowed to point to a directory shared among various users
but it's not allowed any longer. This may be allowed once
[issue #11100](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11100){: .external} is addressed.

If the `--output_base` option is specified, it overrides
using `--output_user_root` to calculate the output base.

The install base location is calculated based on
`--output_user_root`, plus the MD5 identity of the Bazel embedded
binaries.

You can use the `--output_user_root` option to choose an
alternate base location for all of Bazel's output (install base and output
base) if there is a better location in your filesystem layout.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--server_javabase={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#server-javabase}

Specifies the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_ runs. The value must be a path to
the directory containing a JDK or JRE. It should not be a label.
This option should appear before any Bazel command, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --server_javabase=/usr/local/buildtools/java/jdk build //foo
</pre>

This flag does _not_ affect the JVMs used by Bazel subprocesses such as applications, tests,
tools, and so on. Use build options [--javabase](#javabase) or
[--host_javabase](#host-javabase) instead.

This flag was previously named `--host_javabase` (sometimes referred to as the
'left-hand side' `--host_javabase`), but was renamed to avoid confusion with the
build flag [--host_javabase](#host-javabase) (sometimes referred to as the
'right-hand side' `--host_javabase`).

#### `--host_jvm_args={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-jvm-args}

Specifies a startup option to be passed to the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_
runs. This can be used to set the stack size, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --host_jvm_args="-Xss256K" build //foo
</pre>

This option can be used multiple times with individual arguments. Note that
setting this flag should rarely be needed. You can also pass a space-separated list of strings,
each of which will be interpreted as a separate JVM argument, but this feature will soon be
deprecated.

That this does _not_ affect any JVMs used by
subprocesses of Bazel: applications, tests, tools, and so on. To pass
JVM options to executable Java programs, whether run by `bazel
run` or on the command-line, you should use
the `--jvm_flags` argument which
all `java_binary` and `java_test` programs
support. Alternatively for tests, use `bazel test --test_arg=--jvm_flags=foo ...`.

#### `--host_jvm_debug` {:#host-java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine to wait for a connection
from a JDWP-compliant debugger before
calling the main method of _Bazel itself_. This is primarily
intended for use by Bazel developers.

Note: This does _not_ affect any JVMs used by subprocesses of Bazel:
applications, tests, tools, etc.

#### `--autodetect_server_javabase` {:#autodetect-server-javabase}

This option causes Bazel to automatically search for an installed JDK on startup,
and to fall back to the installed JRE if the embedded JRE isn't available.
`--explicit_server_javabase` can be used to pick an explicit JRE to
run Bazel with.

#### `--batch` {:#batch}

Batch mode causes Bazel to not use the
[standard client/server mode](/run/client-server), but instead runs a bazel
java process for a single command, which has been used for more predictable
semantics with respect to signal handling, job control, and environment
variable inheritance, and is necessary for running bazel in a chroot jail.

Batch mode retains proper queueing semantics within the same output_base.
That is, simultaneous invocations will be processed in order, without overlap.
If a batch mode Bazel is run on a client with a running server, it first
kills the server before processing the command.

Bazel will run slower in batch mode, or with the alternatives described above.
This is because, among other things, the build file cache is memory-resident, so it is not
preserved between sequential batch invocations.
Therefore, using batch mode often makes more sense in cases where performance
is less critical, such as continuous builds.

Warning: `--batch` is sufficiently slower than standard
client/server mode. Additionally it might not support all of the features and optimizations which
are made possible by a persistent Bazel server. If you're using `--batch`
for the purpose of build isolation, you should use the command option
`--nokeep_state_after_build`, which guarantees that no incremental
in-memory state is kept between builds. In order to restart the Bazel server and JVM after a
build, please explicitly do so using the "shutdown" command.

#### `--max_idle_secs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#max-idle-secs}

This option specifies how long, in seconds, the Bazel server process
should wait after the last client request, before it exits. The
default value is 10800 (3 hours). `--max_idle_secs=0` will cause the
Bazel server process to persist indefinitely.

Note: this flag is only read if Bazel needs
to start a new server. Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.

Note: system sleep time where a build is not running is counted as idle time.

This option may be used by scripts that invoke Bazel to ensure that
they do not leave Bazel server processes on a user's machine when they
would not be running otherwise.
For example, a presubmit script might wish to
invoke `bazel query` to ensure that a user's pending
change does not introduce unwanted dependencies. However, if the
user has not done a recent build in that workspace, it would be
undesirable for the presubmit script to start a Bazel server just
for it to remain idle for the rest of the day.
By specifying a small value of `--max_idle_secs` in the
query request, the script can ensure that _if_ it caused a new
server to start, that server will exit promptly, but if instead
there was already a server running, that server will continue to run
until it has been idle for the usual time. Of course, the existing
server's idle timer will be reset.

#### `--[no]shutdown_on_low_sys_mem` {:#shutdown-on-low-sys-mem}

If enabled and `--max_idle_secs` is set to a positive duration,
after the build server has been idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is
low on memory. Linux only.

In addition to running an idle check corresponding to max_idle_secs, the build server will
starts monitoring available system memory after the server has been idle for some time.
If the available system memory becomes critically low, the server will exit.

#### `--[no]block_for_lock` {:#block-for-lock}

If enabled, Bazel will wait for other Bazel commands holding the
server lock to complete before progressing. If disabled, Bazel will
exit in error if it cannot immediately acquire the lock and
proceed.

Developers might use this in presubmit checks to avoid long waits caused
by another Bazel command in the same client.

#### `--io_nice_level={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#io-nice-level}

Sets a level from 0-7 for best-effort IO scheduling. 0 is highest priority,
7 is lowest. The anticipatory scheduler may only honor up to priority 4.
Negative values are ignored.

#### `--batch_cpu_scheduling` {:#batch-cpu-scheduling}

Use `batch` CPU scheduling for Bazel. This policy is useful for
workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value.
See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. This policy may provide for better system
interactivity at the expense of Bazel throughput.

### Miscellaneous options {:#misc-options}

#### `--[no]announce_rc` {:#announce-rc}

Controls whether Bazel announces startup options and command options read from
the bazelrc files when starting up.

#### `--color (yes|no|auto)` {:#color}

This option determines whether Bazel will use colors to highlight
its output on the screen.

If this option is set to `yes`, color output is enabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, Bazel will use color output only if
the output is being sent to a terminal and the TERM environment variable
is set to a value other than `dumb`, `emacs`, or `xterm-mono`.
If this option is set to `no`, color output is disabled,
regardless of whether the output is going to a terminal and regardless
of the setting of the TERM environment variable.

#### `--config={{ "<var>" }}name{{ "</var>" }}` {:#config}

Selects additional config section from
[the rc files](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-file-locations); for the current `command`,
it also pulls in the options from `command:name` if such a section exists. Can be
specified multiple times to add flags from several config sections. Expansions can refer to other
definitions (for example, expansions can be chained).

#### `--curses (yes|no|auto)` {:#curses}

This option determines whether Bazel will use cursor controls
in its screen output. This results in less scrolling data, and a more
compact, easy-to-read stream of output from Bazel. This works well with
`--color`.

If this option is set to `yes`, use of cursor controls is enabled.
If this option is set to `no`, use of cursor controls is disabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, use of cursor controls will be
enabled under the same conditions as for `--color=auto`.

#### `--[no]show_timestamps` {:#show-timestamps}

If specified, a timestamp is added to each message generated by
Bazel specifying the time at which the message was displayed.

# Sandboxing

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This article covers sandboxing in Bazel and debugging your sandboxing
environment.

*Sandboxing* is a permission restricting strategy that isolates processes from
each other or from resources in a system. For Bazel, this means restricting file
system access.

Bazel's file system sandbox runs processes in a working directory that only
contains known inputs, such that compilers and other tools don't see source
files they should not access, unless they know the absolute paths to them.

Sandboxing doesn't hide the host environment in any way. Processes can freely
access all files on the file system. However, on platforms that support user
namespaces, processes can't modify any files outside their working directory.
This ensures that the build graph doesn't have hidden dependencies that could
affect the reproducibility of the build.

More specifically, Bazel constructs an `execroot/` directory for each action,
which acts as the action's work directory at execution time. `execroot/`
contains all input files to the action and serves as the container for any
generated outputs. Bazel then uses an operating-system-provided technique,
containers on Linux and `sandbox-exec` on macOS, to constrain the action within
`execroot/`.

## Reasons for sandboxing {:#sandboxing-reasons}

-   Without action sandboxing, Bazel doesn't know if a tool uses undeclared
    input files (files that are not explicitly listed in the dependencies of an
    action). When one of the undeclared input files changes, Bazel still
    believes that the build is up-to-date and won’t rebuild the action. This can
    result in an incorrect incremental build.

-   Incorrect reuse of cache entries creates problems during remote caching. A
    bad cache entry in a shared cache affects every developer on the project,
    and wiping the entire remote cache is not a feasible solution.

-   Sandboxing mimics the behavior of remote execution — if a build works well
    with sandboxing, it will likely also work with remote execution. By making
    remote execution upload all necessary files (including local tools), you can
    significantly reduce maintenance costs for compile clusters compared to
    having to install the tools on every machine in the cluster every time you
    want to try out a new compiler or make a change to an existing tool.

## What sandbox strategy to use {:#sandboxing-strategies}

You can choose which kind of sandboxing to use, if any, with the
[strategy flags](user-manual.html#strategy-options). Using the `sandboxed`
strategy makes Bazel pick one of the sandbox implementations listed below,
preferring an OS-specific sandbox to the less hermetic generic one.
[Persistent workers](/remote/persistent) run in a generic sandbox if you pass
the `--worker_sandboxing` flag.

The `local` (a.k.a. `standalone`) strategy does not do any kind of sandboxing.
It simply executes the action's command line with the working directory set to
the execroot of your workspace.

`processwrapper-sandbox` is a sandboxing strategy that does not require any
"advanced" features - it should work on any POSIX system out of the box. It
builds a sandbox directory consisting of symlinks that point to the original
source files, executes the action's command line with the working directory set
to this directory instead of the execroot, then moves the known output artifacts
out of the sandbox into the execroot and deletes the sandbox. This prevents the
action from accidentally using any input files that are not declared and from
littering the execroot with unknown output files.

`linux-sandbox` goes one step further and builds on top of the
`processwrapper-sandbox`. Similar to what Docker does under the hood, it uses
Linux Namespaces (User, Mount, PID, Network and IPC namespaces) to isolate the
action from the host. That is, it makes the entire filesystem read-only except
for the sandbox directory, so the action cannot accidentally modify anything on
the host filesystem. This prevents situations like a buggy test accidentally rm
-rf'ing your $HOME directory. Optionally, you can also prevent the action from
accessing the network. `linux-sandbox` uses PID namespaces to prevent the action
from seeing any other processes and to reliably kill all processes (even daemons
spawned by the action) at the end.

`darwin-sandbox` is similar, but for macOS. It uses Apple's `sandbox-exec` tool
to achieve roughly the same as the Linux sandbox.

Both the `linux-sandbox` and the `darwin-sandbox` do not work in a "nested"
scenario due to restrictions in the mechanisms provided by the operating
systems. Because Docker also uses Linux namespaces for its container magic, you
cannot easily run `linux-sandbox` inside a Docker container, unless you use
`docker run --privileged`. On macOS, you cannot run `sandbox-exec` inside a
process that's already being sandboxed. Thus, in these cases, Bazel
automatically falls back to using `processwrapper-sandbox`.

If you would rather get a build error — such as to not accidentally build with a
less strict execution strategy — explicitly modify the list of execution
strategies that Bazel tries to use (for example, `bazel build
--spawn_strategy=worker,linux-sandbox`).

Dynamic execution usually requires sandboxing for local execution. To opt out,
pass the `--experimental_local_lockfree_output` flag. Dynamic execution silently
sandboxes [persistent workers](/remote/persistent).

## Downsides to sandboxing {:#sandboxing_downsides}

-   Sandboxing incurs extra setup and teardown cost. How big this cost is
    depends on many factors, including the shape of the build and the
    performance of the host OS. For Linux, sandboxed builds are rarely more than
    a few percent slower. Setting `--reuse_sandbox_directories` can
    mitigate the setup and teardown cost.

-   Sandboxing effectively disables any cache the tool may have. You can
    mitigate this by using [persistent workers](/remote/persistent), at
    the cost of weaker sandbox guarantees.

-   [Multiplex workers](/remote/multiplex) require explicit worker support
    to be sandboxed. Workers that do not support multiplex sandboxing run as
    singleplex workers under dynamic execution, which can cost extra memory.

## Debugging {:#debugging}

Follow the strategies below to debug issues with sandboxing.

### Deactivated namespaces {:#deactivated-namespaces}

On some platforms, such as
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/){: .external}
cluster nodes or Debian, user namespaces are deactivated by default due to
security concerns. If the `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` file
exists and contains a 0, you can activate user namespaces by running:

```posix-terminal
   sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

### Rule execution failures {:#rule-failures}

The sandbox may fail to execute rules because of the system setup. If you see a
message like `namespace-sandbox.c:633: execvp(argv[0], argv): No such file or
directory`, try to deactivate the sandbox with `--strategy=Genrule=local` for
genrules, and `--spawn_strategy=local` for other rules.

### Detailed debugging for build failures {:#debugging-build-failures}

If your build failed, use `--verbose_failures` and `--sandbox_debug` to make
Bazel show the exact command it ran when your build failed, including the part
that sets up the sandbox.

Example error message:

```
ERROR: path/to/your/project/BUILD:1:1: compilation of rule
'//path/to/your/project:all' failed:

Sandboxed execution failed, which may be legitimate (such as a compiler error),
or due to missing dependencies. To enter the sandbox environment for easier
debugging, run the following command in parentheses. On command failure, a bash
shell running inside the sandbox will then automatically be spawned

namespace-sandbox failed: error executing command
  (cd /some/path && \
  exec env - \
    LANG=en_US \
    PATH=/some/path/bin:/bin:/usr/bin \
    PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/some/path \
  /some/path/namespace-sandbox @/sandbox/root/path/this-sandbox-name.params --
  /some/path/to/your/some-compiler --some-params some-target)
```

You can now inspect the generated sandbox directory and see which files Bazel
created and run the command again to see how it behaves.

Note that Bazel does not delete the sandbox directory when you use
`--sandbox_debug`. Unless you are actively debugging, you should disable
`--sandbox_debug` because it fills up your disk over time.

# Apple Apps and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel to build macOS and iOS
projects. It links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to
using Bazel to build and test for those platforms.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on macOS and iOS projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building an iOS app](/start/ios-app)
*  [Objective-C build rules](/reference/be/objective-c)
*  [General Apple rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple){: .external}
*  [Integration with Xcode](/install/ide)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your macOS and iOS projects with Xcode, follow the steps
in the migration guide to start building them with Bazel:

## Apple apps and new rules {:#apple-apps-new-rules}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios.
You do not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts)
when building your macOS and iOS projects:

*  Modules:

   *  [`apple_bitcode_mode`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_bitcode_mode)
   *  [`apple_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/apple_common)
   *  [`apple_platform`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform)

*  Providers:

   *  [`ObjcProvider`](/rules/lib/providers/ObjcProvider)
   *  [`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig)

## Xcode selection {:#xcode-selection}

If your build requires Xcode, Bazel will select an appropriate version based on
the `--xcode_config` and `--xcode_version` flags. The `--xcode_config` consumes
the set of available Xcode versions and sets a default version if
`--xcode_version` is not passed. This default is overridden by the
`--xcode_version` flag, as long as it is set to an Xcode version that is
represented in the `--xcode_config` target.

If you do not pass `--xcode_config`, Bazel will use the autogenerated
[`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig) that represents the
Xcode versions available on your host machine. The default version is
the newest available Xcode version. This is appropriate for local execution.

If you are performing remote builds, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `versions` attribute is a list of remotely available
[`xcode_version`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version)
targets, and whose `default` attribute is one of these
[`xcode_versions`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version).

If you are using dynamic execution, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `remote_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the remotely available Xcode versions, and whose
`local_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the locally available Xcode versions. For `local_versions`,
you probably want to use the autogenerated
`@local_config_xcode//:host_available_xcodes`. The default Xcode version is the
newest mutually available version, if there is one, otherwise the default of the
`local_versions` target. If you prefer to use the `local_versions` default
as the default, you can pass `--experimental_prefer_mutual_default=false`.

# Java and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with Java projects. It
links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building
Java projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on Java projects:

*   [Tutorial: Building a Java Project](/start/java)
*   [Java rules](/reference/be/java)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your Java projects with Maven, follow the steps in the
migration guide to start building your Maven projects with Bazel:

*   [Migrating from Maven to Bazel](/migrate/maven)

## Java versions {:#java-versions}

There are two relevant versions of Java that are set with configuration flags:

*   the version of the source files in the repository
*   the version of the Java runtime that is used to execute the code and to test
    it

### Configuring the version of the source code in your repository {:#config-source-code}

Without an additional configuration, Bazel assumes all Java source files in the
repository are written in a single Java version. To specify the version of the
sources in the repository add `build --java_language_version={ver}` to
`.bazelrc` file, where `{ver}` is for example `11`. Bazel repository owners
should set this flag so that Bazel and its users can reference the source code's
Java version number. For more details, see
[Java language version flag](/docs/user-manual#java-language-version).

### Configuring the JVM used to execute and test the code {:#config-jvm}

Bazel uses one JDK for compilation and another JVM to execute and test the code.

By default Bazel compiles the code using a JDK it downloads and it executes and
tests the code with the JVM installed on the local machine. Bazel searches for
the JVM using `JAVA_HOME` or path.

The resulting binaries are compatible with locally installed JVM in system
libraries, which means the resulting binaries depend on what is installed on the
machine.

To configure the JVM used for execution and testing use `--java_runtime_version`
flag. The default value is `local_jdk`.

### Hermetic testing and compilation {:#hermetic-testing}

To create a hermetic compile, you can use command line flag
`--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11`. The code is compiled for, executed, and
tested on the JVM downloaded from a remote repository. For more details, see
[Java runtime version flag](/docs/user-manual#java_runtime_version).

### Configuring compilation and execution of build tools in Java {:#config-build-tools-java}

There is a second pair of JDK and JVM used to build and execute tools, which are
used in the build process, but are not in the build results. That JDK and JVM
are controlled using `--tool_java_language_version` and
`--tool_java_runtime_version`. Default values are `11` and `remotejdk_11`,
respectively.

#### Compiling using locally installed JDK {:#compile-using-jdk}

Bazel by default compiles using remote JDK, because it is overriding JDK's
internals. The compilation toolchains using locally installed JDK are configured,
however not used.

To compile using locally installed JDK, that is use the compilation toolchains
for local JDK, use additional flag `--extra_toolchains=@local_jdk//:all`,
however, mind that this may not work on JDK of arbitrary vendors.

For more details, see
[configuring Java toolchains](#config-java-toolchains).

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to Java projects.

### Directory structure {:#directory-structure}

Prefer Maven's standard directory layout (sources under `src/main/java`, tests
under `src/test/java`).

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow these guidelines when creating your `BUILD` files:

*   Use one `BUILD` file per directory containing Java sources, because this
    improves build performance.

*   Every `BUILD` file should contain one `java_library` rule that looks like
    this:

    ```python
    java_library(
        name = "directory-name",
        srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
        deps = [...],
    )
    ```

*   The name of the library should be the name of the directory containing the
    `BUILD` file. This makes the label of the library shorter, that is use
    `"//package"` instead of `"//package:package"`.

*   The sources should be a non-recursive [`glob`](/reference/be/functions#glob) of
    all Java files in the directory.

*   Tests should be in a matching directory under `src/test` and depend on this
    library.

## Creating new rules for advanced Java builds {:#rules-advanced-java-builds}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios. You do
not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts) when building your Java
projects:

*   Main Java module: [`java_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/java_common)
*   Main Java provider: [`JavaInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaInfo)
*   Configuration fragment: [`java`](/rules/lib/fragments/java)
*   Other modules:

    *   [`java_annotation_processing`](/rules/lib/builtins/java_annotation_processing)
    *   [`java_compilation_info`](/rules/lib/providers/java_compilation_info)
    *   [`java_output_jars`](/rules/lib/providers/java_output_jars)
    *   [`JavaRuntimeInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaRuntimeInfo)
    *   [`JavaToolchainInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaToolchainInfo)

## Configuring the Java toolchains {:#config-java-toolchains}

Bazel uses two types of Java toolchains:
- execution, used to execute and test Java binaries, controlled with
  `--java_runtime_version` flag
- compilation, used to compile Java sources, controlled with
  `--java_language_version` flag

### Configuring additional execution toolchains {:#config-execution-toolchains}

Execution toolchain is the JVM, either local or from a repository, with some
additional information about its version, operating system, and CPU
architecture.

Java execution toolchains may added using the `local_java_repository` or
`remote_java_repository` repo rules in a module extension. Adding the rule makes
the JVM available using a flag. When multiple definitions for the same operating
system and CPU architecture are given, the first one is used.

Example configuration of local JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:local_java_repository.bzl", "local_java_repository")

local_java_repository(
  name = "additionaljdk",          # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk, --java_runtime_version=11 or --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk_11
  version = 11,                    # Optional, if not set it is autodetected
  java_home = "/usr/lib/jdk-15/",  # Path to directory containing bin/java
)
```

Example configuration of remote JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:remote_java_repository.bzl", "remote_java_repository")

remote_java_repository(
  name = "openjdk_canary_linux_arm",
  prefix = "openjdk_canary", # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=openjdk_canary_11
  version = "11",            # or --java_runtime_version=11
  target_compatible_with = [ # Specifies constraints this JVM is compatible with
    "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    "@platforms//os:linux",
  ],
  urls = ...,               # Other parameters are from http_repository rule.
  sha256 = ...,
  strip_prefix = ...
)
```

### Configuring additional compilation toolchains {:#config-compilation-toolchains}

Compilation toolchain is composed of JDK and multiple tools that Bazel uses
during the compilation and that provides additional features, such as: Error
Prone, strict Java dependencies, header compilation, Android desugaring,
coverage instrumentation, and genclass handling for IDEs.

JavaBuilder is a Bazel-bundled tool that executes compilation, and provides the
aforementioned features. Actual compilation is executed using the internal
compiler by the JDK. The JDK used for compilation is specified by `java_runtime`
attribute of the toolchain.

Bazel overrides some JDK internals. In case of JDK version > 9,
`java.compiler` and `jdk.compiler` modules are patched using JDK's flag
`--patch_module`. In case of JDK version 8, the Java compiler is patched using
`-Xbootclasspath` flag.

VanillaJavaBuilder is a second implementation of JavaBuilder,
which does not modify JDK's internal compiler and does not have any of the
additional features. VanillaJavaBuilder is not used by any of the built-in
toolchains.

In addition to JavaBuilder, Bazel uses several other tools during compilation.

The `ijar` tool processes `jar` files to remove everything except call
signatures. Resulting jars are called header jars. They are used to improve the
compilation incrementality by only recompiling downstream dependents when the
body of a function changes.

The `singlejar` tool packs together multiple `jar` files into a single one.

The `genclass` tool post-processes the output of a Java compilation, and produces
a `jar` containing only the class files for sources that were generated by
annotation processors.

The `JacocoRunner` tool runs Jacoco over instrumented files and outputs results in
LCOV format.

The `TestRunner` tool executes JUnit 4 tests in a controlled environment.

You can reconfigure the compilation by adding `default_java_toolchain` macro to
a `BUILD` file and registering it either by adding `register_toolchains` rule to
the `MODULE.bazel` file or by using
[`--extra_toolchains`](/docs/user-manual#extra-toolchains) flag.

The toolchain is only used when the `source_version` attribute matches the
value specified by `--java_language_version` flag.

Example toolchain configuration:

```python
load(
  "@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl",
  "default_java_toolchain", "DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION", "BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS", "DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS"
)

default_java_toolchain(
  name = "repository_default_toolchain",
  configuration = DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION,        # One of predefined configurations
                                                          # Other parameters are from java_toolchain rule:
  java_runtime = "@rules_java//toolchains:remote_jdk11", # JDK to use for compilation and toolchain's tools execution
  jvm_opts = BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional JDK options
  javacopts = DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional javac options
  source_version = "9",
)
```

which can be used using `--extra_toolchains=//:repository_default_toolchain_definition`
or by adding `register_toolchains("//:repository_default_toolchain_definition")`
to the workpace.

Predefined configurations:

-   `DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: all features, supports JDK versions >= 9
-   `VANILLA_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: no additional features, supports JDKs of
    arbitrary vendors.
-   `PREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but only use prebuilt
    tools (`ijar`, `singlejar`)
-   `NONPREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but all tools are
    built from sources (this may be useful on operating system with different
    libc)

#### Configuring JVM and Java compiler flags {:#config-jvm}

You may configure JVM and javac flags either with flags or with
 `default_java_toolchain` attributes.

The relevant flags are `--jvmopt`, `--host_jvmopt`, `--javacopt`,  and
`--host_javacopt`.

The relevant `default_java_toolchain` attributes are `javacopts`, `jvm_opts`,
`javabuilder_jvm_opts`, and `turbine_jvm_opts`.

#### Package specific Java compiler flags configuration {:#package-java-compiler-flags}

You can configure different Java compiler flags for specific source
files using `package_configuration` attribute of `default_java_toolchain`.
Please refer to the example below.

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl", "default_java_toolchain")

# This is a convenience macro that inherits values from Bazel's default java_toolchain
default_java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    package_configuration = [
        ":error_prone",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# This associates a set of javac flags with a set of packages
java_package_configuration(
    name = "error_prone",
    javacopts = [
        "-Xep:MissingOverride:ERROR",
    ],
    packages = ["error_prone_packages"],
)

# This is a regular package_group, which is used to specify a set of packages to apply flags to
package_group(
    name = "error_prone_packages",
    packages = [
        "//foo/...",
        "-//foo/bar/...", # this is an exclusion
    ],
)
```

#### Multiple versions of Java source code in a single repository {:#java-source-single-repo}

Bazel only supports compiling a single version of Java sources in a build.
build. This means that when building a Java test or an application, all
 dependencies are built against the same Java version.

However, separate builds may be executed using different flags.

To make the task of using different flags easier, sets of flags for a specific
version may be grouped with `.bazelrc` configs":

```python
build:java8 --java_language_version=8
build:java8 --java_runtime_version=local_jdk_8
build:java11 --java_language_version=11
build:java11 --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11
```

These configs can be used with the `--config` flag, for example
`bazel test --config=java11 //:java11_test`.

# Android Instrumentation Tests

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

![Running Android instrumentation tests in parallel](/docs/images/android_test.gif "Android instrumentation test")

**Figure 1.** Running parallel Android instrumentation tests.

[`android_instrumentation_test`](/reference/be/android#android_instrumentation_test)
allows developers to test their apps on Android emulators and devices.
It utilizes real Android framework APIs and the Android Test Library.

For hermeticity and reproducibility, Bazel creates and launches Android
emulators in a sandbox, ensuring that tests always run from a clean state. Each
test gets an isolated emulator instance, allowing tests to run in parallel
without passing states between them.

For more information on Android instrumentation tests, check out the [Android
developer
documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests.html){: .external}.

Please file issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues){: .external}.

## How it works {:#how-it-works}

When you run `bazel test` on an `android_instrumentation_test` target for the
first time, Bazel performs the following steps:

1. Builds the test APK, APK under test, and their transitive dependencies
2. Creates, boots, and caches clean emulator states
3. Starts the emulator
4. Installs the APKs
5. Runs tests utilizing the [Android Test Orchestrator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator){: .external}
6. Shuts down the emulator
7. Reports the results

In subsequent test runs, Bazel boots the emulator from the clean, cached state
created in step 2, so there are no leftover states from previous runs. Caching
emulator state also speeds up test runs.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Ensure your environment satisfies the following prerequisites:

- **Linux**. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, and 18.04.

- **Bazel 0.12.0** or later. Verify the version by running `bazel info release`.

```posix-terminal
bazel info release
```
This results in output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
release 4.1.0
```

- **KVM**. Bazel requires emulators to have [hardware
  acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#accel-check){: .external}
  with KVM on Linux. You can follow these
  [installation instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation){: .external}
  for Ubuntu.

To verify that KVM has the correct configuration, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install cpu-checker && kvm-ok
```

If it prints the following message, you have the correct configuration:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

- **Xvfb**. To run headless tests (for example, on CI servers), Bazel requires
  the [X virtual framebuffer](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml).

To install it, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install xvfb
```
Verify that `Xvfb` is installed correctly and is installed at `/usr/bin/Xvfb`
by running:

```posix-terminal
which Xvfb
```
The output is the following:

```{:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
/usr/bin/Xvfb
```

- **32-bit Libraries**. Some of the binaries used by the test infrastructure are
  32-bit, so on 64-bit machines, ensure that 32-bit binaries can be run. For
  Ubuntu, install these 32-bit libraries:

```posix-terminal
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

## Getting started {:#getting-started}

Here is a typical target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`:

![The target dependency graph on an Android instrumentation test](/docs/images/android_instrumentation_test.png "Target dependency graph")

**Figure 2.** Target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`.


### BUILD file {:#build-file}

The graph translates into a `BUILD` file like this:

```python
android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test",
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86",
)

# Test app and library
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = ":my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidTestManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_test_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_test_lib",
    srcs = glob(["javatest/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        ":my_app_lib",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
    ],
    # ...
)

# Target app and library under test
android_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_app_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_app_lib",
    srcs = glob(["java/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@maven//:androidx_appcompat_appcompat",
        "@maven//:androidx_annotation_annotation",
    ]
    # ...
)
```

The main attributes of the rule `android_instrumentation_test` are:

- `test_app`: An `android_binary` target. This target contains test code and
  dependencies like Espresso and UIAutomator. The selected `android_binary`
  target is required to specify an `instruments` attribute pointing to another
  `android_binary`, which is the app under test.

- `target_device`: An `android_device` target. This target describes the
  specifications of the Android emulator which Bazel uses to create, launch and
  run the tests. See the [section on choosing an Android
  device](#android-device-target) for more information.

The test app's `AndroidManifest.xml` must include [an `<instrumentation>`
tag](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/#configure_instrumentation_manifest_settings){: .external}.
This tag must specify the attributes for the **package of the target app** and
the **fully qualified class name of the instrumentation test runner**,
`androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`.

Here is an example `AndroidTestManifest.xml` for the test app:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="com.example.android.app.test"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">

    <instrumentation
        android:name="androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        android:targetPackage="com.example.android.app" />

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="16"

```

### WORKSPACE dependencies {:#workspace-dependencies}

In order to use this rule, your project needs to depend on these external
repositories:

- `@androidsdk`: The Android SDK. Download this through Android Studio.

- `@android_test_support`: Hosts the test runner, emulator launcher, and
  `android_device` targets. You can find the [latest release
  here](https://github.com/android/android-test/releases){: .external}.

Enable these dependencies by adding the following lines to your `WORKSPACE`
file:

```python
# Android SDK
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # or set ANDROID_HOME
)

# Android Test Support
ATS_COMMIT = "$COMMIT_HASH"
http_archive(
    name = "android_test_support",
    strip_prefix = "android-test-%s" % ATS_COMMIT,
    urls = ["https://github.com/android/android-test/archive/%s.tar.gz" % ATS_COMMIT],
)
load("@android_test_support//:repo.bzl", "android_test_repositories")
android_test_repositories()
```

## Maven dependencies {:#maven-dependencies}

For managing dependencies on Maven artifacts from repositories, such as [Google
Maven](https://maven.google.com){: .external} or [Maven Central](https://central.maven.org){: .external},
you should use a Maven resolver, such as
[`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external){: .external}.

The rest of this page shows how to use `rules_jvm_external` to
resolve and fetch dependencies from Maven repositories.

## Choosing an android_device target {:#android-device-target}

`android_instrumentation_test.target_device` specifies which Android device to
run the tests on. These `android_device` targets are defined in
[`@android_test_support`](https://github.com/google/android-testing-support-library/tree/master/tools/android/emulated_devices){: .external}.

For example, you can query for the sources for a particular target by running:

```posix-terminal
bazel query --output=build @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86
```
Which results in output that looks similar to:

```python
# .../external/android_test_support/tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43:1
android_device(
  name = "android_23_x86",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
  tags = ["requires-kvm"],
  generator_name = "generic_phone",
  generator_function = "make_device",
  generator_location = "tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43",
  vertical_resolution = 800,
  horizontal_resolution = 480,
  ram = 2048,
  screen_density = 240,
  cache = 32,
  vm_heap = 256,
  system_image = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86_images",
  default_properties = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:_android_23_x86_props",
)
```

The device target names use this template:

```
@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/{{ "<var>" }}device_type{{ "</var>" }}:{{ "<var>" }}system{{ "</var>" }}_{{ "<var>" }}api_level{{ "</var>" }}_x86_qemu2
```

In order to launch an `android_device`, the `system_image` for the selected API
level is required. To download the system image, use Android SDK's
`tools/bin/sdkmanager`. For example, to download the system image for
`generic_phone:android_23_x86`, run `$sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager
"system-images;android-23;default;x86"`.

To see the full list of supported `android_device` targets in
`@android_test_support`, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel query 'filter("x86_qemu2$", kind(android_device, @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/...:*))'
```

Bazel currently supports x86-based emulators only. For better performance, use
`QEMU2` `android_device` targets instead of `QEMU` ones.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To run tests, add these lines to your project's
`{{ '<var>' }}project root{{ '</var>' }}:{{ '<var>' }}/.bazelrc` file.

```
# Configurations for testing with Bazel
# Select a configuration by running
# `bazel test //my:target --config={headless, gui, local_device}`

# Headless instrumentation tests (No GUI)
test:headless --test_arg=--enable_display=false

# Graphical instrumentation tests. Ensure that $DISPLAY is set.
test:gui --test_env=DISPLAY
test:gui --test_arg=--enable_display=true

# Testing with a local emulator or device. Ensure that `adb devices` lists the
# device.
# Run tests serially.
test:local_device --test_strategy=exclusive
# Use the local device broker type, as opposed to WRAPPED_EMULATOR.
test:local_device --test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER
# Uncomment and set $device_id if there is more than one connected device.
# test:local_device --test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id
```

Then, use one of the configurations to run tests:

- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=gui`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=headless`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=local_device`

Use __only one configuration__ or tests will fail.

### Headless testing {:#headless-testing}

With `Xvfb`, it is possible to test with emulators without the graphical
interface, also known as headless testing. To disable the graphical interface
when running tests, pass the test argument `--enable_display=false` to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=false
```

### GUI testing {:#gui-testing}

If the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set, it's possible to enable the
graphical interface of the emulator while the test is running. To do this, pass
these test arguments to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=true --test_env=DISPLAY
```

### Testing with a local emulator or device {:#testing-local-emulator}

Bazel also supports testing directly on a locally launched emulator or connected
device. Pass the flags
`--test_strategy=exclusive` and
`--test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER` to enable local testing mode.
If there is more than one connected device, pass the flag
`--test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id` where `$device_id` is the id of
the device/emulator listed in `adb devices`.

## Sample projects {:#sample-projects}

If you are looking for canonical project samples, see the [Android testing
samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing#experimental-bazel-support){: .external}
for projects using Espresso and UIAutomator.

## Espresso setup {:#espresso-setup}

If you write UI tests with [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/){: .external}
(`androidx.test.espresso`), you can use the following snippets to set up your
Bazel workspace with the list of commonly used Espresso artifacts and their
dependencies:

```
androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core
androidx.test:rules
androidx.test:runner
javax.inject:javax.inject
org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest
junit:junit
```

One way to organize these dependencies is to create a `//:test_deps` shared
library in your `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/BUILD.bazel` file:

```python
java_library(
    name = "test_deps",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    exports = [
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_rules",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:javax_inject_javax_inject"
        "@maven//:org_hamcrest_java_hamcrest",
        "@maven//:junit_junit",
    ],
)
```

Then, add the required dependencies in `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/WORKSPACE`:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "2.8"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "79c9850690d7614ecdb72d68394f994fef7534b292c4867ce5e7dec0aa7bdfad"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
)

load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "junit:junit:4.12",
        "javax.inject:javax.inject:1",
        "org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest:2.0.0.0"
        "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1",
        "androidx.test:rules:aar:1.1.1",
        "androidx.test:runner:aar:1.1.1",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://maven.google.com",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
)
```

Finally, in your test `android_binary` target, add the `//:test_deps`
dependency:

```python
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = "//path/to:app",
    deps = [
        "//:test_deps",
        # ...
    ],
    # ...
)
```

## Tips {:#tips}

### Reading test logs {:#reading-test-logs}

Use `--test_output=errors` to print logs for failing tests, or
`--test_output=all` to print all test output. If you're looking for an
individual test log, go to
`$PROJECT_ROOT/bazel-testlogs/path/to/InstrumentationTestTargetName`.

For example, the test logs for `BasicSample` canonical project are in
`bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest`, run:

```posix-terminal
tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest
```
This results in the following output:

```none

$ tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest

### Reading emulator logs {:#reading-emulator-logs}

The emulator logs for `android_device` targets are stored in the `/tmp/`
directory with the name `emulator_xxxxx.log`, where `xxxxx` is a
randomly-generated sequence of characters.

Use this command to find the latest emulator log:

```posix-terminal
ls -1t /tmp/emulator_*.log | head -n 1
```

### Testing against multiple API levels {:#testing-multiple-apis}

If you would like to test against multiple API levels, you can use a list
comprehension to create test targets for each API level. For example:

```python
API_LEVELS = [
    "19",
    "20",
    "21",
    "22",
]

[android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test_%s" % API_LEVEL,
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_%s_x86_qemu2" % API_LEVEL,
) for API_LEVEL in API_LEVELS]
```

## Known issues {:#known-issues}

- [Forked adb server processes are not terminated after
  tests](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4853){: .external}
- While APK building works on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), testing
  only works on Linux.
- Even with `--config=local_adb`, users still need to specify
  `android_instrumentation_test.target_device`.
- If using a local device or emulator, Bazel does not uninstall the APKs after
  the test. Clean the packages by running this command:

```posix-terminal
adb shell pm list
packages com.example.android.testing | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '\r' | xargs
-L1 -t adb uninstall
```

# C++ and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with C++ projects. It links
to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building C++
projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on C++ projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building a C++ project](/start/cpp)
*  [C++ common use cases](/tutorials/cpp-use-cases)
*  [C/C++ rules](/reference/be/c-cpp)
*  Essential Libraries
   -  [Abseil](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/quickstart){: .external}
   -  [Boost](https://github.com/nelhage/rules_boost){: .external}
   -  [HTTPS Requests: CPR and libcurl](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-make-cc-https-easy){: .external}
*  [C++ toolchain configuration](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference)
*  [Tutorial: Configuring C++ toolchains](/tutorials/ccp-toolchain-config)
*  [Integrating with C++ rules](/configure/integrate-cpp)

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to C++ projects.

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow the guidelines below when creating your BUILD files:

*  Each `BUILD` file should contain one [`cc_library`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library)
   rule target per compilation unit in the directory.

*  You should granularize your C++ libraries as much as
   possible to maximize incrementality and parallelize the build.

*  If there is a single source file in `srcs`, name the library the same as
   that C++ file's name. This library should contain C++ file(s), any matching
   header file(s), and the library's direct dependencies. For example:

   ```python
   cc_library(
       name = "mylib",
       srcs = ["mylib.cc"],
       hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
       deps = [":lower-level-lib"]
   )
   ```

*  Use one `cc_test` rule target per `cc_library` target in the file. Name the
   target `[library-name]_test` and the source file `[library-name]_test.cc`.
   For example, a test target for the `mylib` library target shown above would
   look like this:

   ```python
   cc_test(
       name = "mylib_test",
       srcs = ["mylib_test.cc"],
       deps = [":mylib"]
   )
   ```

### Include paths {:#include-paths}

Follow these guidelines for include paths:

*  Make all include paths relative to the workspace directory.

*  Use quoted includes (`#include "foo/bar/baz.h"`) for non-system headers, not
   angle-brackets (`#include <foo/bar/baz.h>`).

*  Avoid using UNIX directory shortcuts, such as `.` (current directory) or `..`
   (parent directory).

*  For legacy or `third_party` code that requires includes pointing outside the
   project repository, such as external repository includes requiring a prefix,
   use the [`include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.include_prefix) and
   [`strip_include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.strip_include_prefix)
   arguments on the `cc_library` rule target.

### Toolchain features {:#toolchain-features}

The following optional [features](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#features)
can improve the hygiene of a C++ project. They can be enabled using the
`--features` command-line flag or the `features` attribute of
[`repo`](/external/overview#repo.bazel),
[`package`](/reference/be/functions#package) or `cc_*` rules:

* The `parse_headers` feature makes it so that the C++ compiler is used to parse
  (but not compile) all header files in the built targets and their dependencies
  when using the
  [`--process_headers_in_dependencies`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--process_headers_in_dependencies)
  flag. This can help catch issues in header-only libraries and ensure that
  headers are self-contained and independent of the order in which they are
  included.
* The `layering_check` feature enforces that targets only include headers
  provided by their direct dependencies. The default toolchain supports this
  feature on Linux with `clang` as the compiler.


Project: /_project.yaml
Book: /_book.yaml

# Configurable Build Attributes

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

**_Configurable attributes_**, commonly known as [`select()`](
/reference/be/functions#select), is a Bazel feature that lets users toggle the values
of build rule attributes at the command line.

This can be used, for example, for a multiplatform library that automatically
chooses the appropriate implementation for the architecture, or for a
feature-configurable binary that can be customized at build time.

## Example {:#configurable-build-example}

```python
# myapp/BUILD

cc_binary(
    name = "mybinary",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = select({
        ":arm_build": [":arm_lib"],
        ":x86_debug_build": [":x86_dev_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":generic_lib"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "arm_build",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_debug_build",
    values = {
        "cpu": "x86",
        "compilation_mode": "dbg",
    },
)
```

This declares a `cc_binary` that "chooses" its deps based on the flags at the
command line. Specifically, `deps` becomes:

<table>
  <tr style="background: #E9E9E9; font-weight: bold">
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>deps =</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=arm</code></td>
    <td><code>[":arm_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=x86</code></td>
    <td><code>[":x86_dev_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

`select()` serves as a placeholder for a value that will be chosen based on
*configuration conditions*, which are labels referencing [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)
targets. By using `select()` in a configurable attribute, the attribute
effectively adopts different values when different conditions hold.

Matches must be unambiguous: if multiple conditions match then either:

*  They all resolve to the same value. For example, when running on linux x86, this is unambiguous
   `{"@platforms//os:linux": "Hello", "@platforms//cpu:x86_64": "Hello"}` because both branches resolve to "hello".
*  One's `values` is a strict superset of all others'. For example, `values = {"cpu": "x86", "compilation_mode": "dbg"}`
   is an unambiguous specialization of `values = {"cpu": "x86"}`.

The built-in condition [`//conditions:default`](#default-condition) automatically matches when
nothing else does.

While this example uses `deps`, `select()` works just as well on `srcs`,
`resources`, `cmd`, and most other attributes. Only a small number of attributes
are *non-configurable*, and these are clearly annotated. For example,
`config_setting`'s own
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute is non-configurable.

## `select()` and dependencies {:#select-and-dependencies}

Certain attributes change the build parameters for all transitive dependencies
under a target. For example, `genrule`'s `tools` changes `--cpu` to the CPU of
the machine running Bazel (which, thanks to cross-compilation, may be different
than the CPU the target is built for). This is known as a
[configuration transition](/reference/glossary#transition).

Given

```python
#myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "arm_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

genrule(
    name = "my_genrule",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["g_arm.src"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["g_x86.src"],
    }),
    tools = select({
        ":arm_cpu": [":tool1"],
        ":x86_cpu": [":tool2"],
    }),
)

cc_binary(
    name = "tool1",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["armtool.cc"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["x86tool.cc"],
    }),
)
```

running

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_genrule --cpu=arm
```

on an `x86` developer machine binds the build to `g_arm.src`, `tool1`, and
`x86tool.cc`. Both of the `select`s attached to `my_genrule` use `my_genrule`'s
build parameters, which include `--cpu=arm`. The `tools` attribute changes
`--cpu` to `x86` for `tool1` and its transitive dependencies. The `select` on
`tool1` uses `tool1`'s build parameters, which include `--cpu=x86`.

## Configuration conditions {:#configuration-conditions}

Each key in a configurable attribute is a label reference to a
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting) or
[`constraint_value`](/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#constraint_value).

`config_setting` is just a collection of
expected command line flag settings. By encapsulating these in a target, it's
easy to maintain "standard" conditions users can reference from multiple places.

`constraint_value` provides support for [multi-platform behavior](#platforms).

### Built-in flags {:#built-in-flags}

Flags like `--cpu` are built into Bazel: the build tool natively understands
them for all builds in all projects. These are specified with
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    values = {
        "flag1": "value1",
        "flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

`flagN` is a flag name (without `--`, so `"cpu"` instead of `"--cpu"`). `valueN`
is the expected value for that flag. `:meaningful_condition_name` matches if
*every* entry in `values` matches. Order is irrelevant.

`valueN` is parsed as if it was set on the command line. This means:

*  `values = { "compilation_mode": "opt" }` matches `bazel build -c opt`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "true" }` matches `bazel build --force_pic=1`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "0" }` matches `bazel build --noforce_pic`

`config_setting` only supports flags that affect target behavior. For example,
[`--show_progress`](/docs/user-manual#show-progress) isn't allowed because
it only affects how Bazel reports progress to the user. Targets can't use that
flag to construct their results. The exact set of supported flags isn't
documented. In practice, most flags that "make sense" work.

### Custom flags {:#custom-flags}

You can model your own project-specific flags with
[Starlark build settings][BuildSettings]. Unlike built-in flags, these are
defined as build targets, so Bazel references them with target labels.

These are triggered with [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`flag_values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.flag_values)
attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    flag_values = {
        "//myflags:flag1": "value1",
        "//myflags:flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

Behavior is the same as for [built-in flags](#built-in-flags). See [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/select_on_build_setting){: .external}
for a working example.

[`--define`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--define)
is an alternative legacy syntax for custom flags (for example
`--define foo=bar`). This can be expressed either in the
[values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute
(`values = {"define": "foo=bar"}`) or the
[define_values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.define_values) attribute
(`define_values = {"foo": "bar"}`). `--define` is only supported for backwards
compatibility. Prefer Starlark build settings whenever possible.

`values`, `flag_values`, and `define_values` evaluate independently. The
`config_setting` matches if all values across all of them match.

## The default condition {:#default-condition}

The built-in condition `//conditions:default` matches when no other condition
matches.

Because of the "exactly one match" rule, a configurable attribute with no match
and no default condition emits a `"no matching conditions"` error. This can
protect against silent failures from unexpected settings:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

cc_library(
    name = "x86_only_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":x86_cpu": ["lib.cc"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:x86_only_lib --cpu=arm
ERROR: Configurable attribute "srcs" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //myapp:x86_cpu
```

For even clearer errors, you can set custom messages with `select()`'s
[`no_match_error`](#custom-error-messages) attribute.

## Platforms {:#platforms}

While the ability to specify multiple flags on the command line provides
flexibility, it can also be burdensome to individually set each one every time
you want to build a target.
   [Platforms](/extending/platforms)
let you consolidate these into simple bundles.

```python
# myapp/BUILD

sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":basalt": ["pyroxene.sh"],
        ":marble": ["calcite.sh"],
        "//conditions:default": ["feldspar.sh"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "basalt",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

config_setting(
    name = "marble",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)

# constraint_setting acts as an enum type, and constraint_value as an enum value.
constraint_setting(name = "color")
constraint_value(name = "black", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_value(name = "white", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_setting(name = "texture")
constraint_value(name = "smooth", constraint_setting = "texture")
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")

platform(
    name = "basalt_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

platform(
    name = "marble_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":smooth",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)
```

The platform can be specified on the command line. It activates the
`config_setting`s that contain a subset of the platform's `constraint_values`,
allowing those `config_setting`s to match in `select()` expressions.

For example, in order to set the `srcs` attribute of `my_rocks` to `calcite.sh`,
you can simply run

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --platforms=//myapp:marble_platform
```

Without platforms, this might look something like

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --define color=white --define texture=smooth --define type=metamorphic
```

`select()` can also directly read `constraint_value`s:

```python
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")
sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":igneous": ["igneous.sh"],
        ":metamorphic" ["metamorphic.sh"],
    }),
)
```

This saves the need for boilerplate `config_setting`s when you only need to
check against single values.

Platforms are still under development. See the
[documentation](/concepts/platforms) for details.

## Combining `select()`s {:#combining-selects}

`select` can appear multiple times in the same attribute:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"] +
           select({
               ":armeabi_mode": ["armeabi_src.sh"],
               ":x86_mode": ["x86_src.sh"],
           }) +
           select({
               ":opt_mode": ["opt_extras.sh"],
               ":dbg_mode": ["dbg_extras.sh"],
           }),
)
```

Note: Some restrictions apply on what can be combined in the `select`s values:
 - Duplicate labels can appear in different paths of the same `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear within the same path of a `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear across multiple combined `select`s (no matter what path)

`select` cannot appear inside another `select`. If you need to nest `selects`
and your attribute takes other targets as values, use an intermediate target:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":armeabi_mode": [":armeabi_lib"],
        ...
    }),
)

sh_library(
    name = "armeabi_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":opt_mode": ["armeabi_with_opt.sh"],
        ...
    }),
)
```

If you need a `select` to match when multiple conditions match, consider [AND
chaining](#and-chaining).

## OR chaining {:#or-chaining}

Consider the following:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config2": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config3": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Most conditions evaluate to the same dep. But this syntax is hard to read and
maintain. It would be nice to not have to repeat `[":standard_lib"]` multiple
times.

One option is to predefine the value as a BUILD variable:

```python
STANDARD_DEP = [":standard_lib"]

sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config2": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config3": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

This makes it easier to manage the dependency. But it still causes unnecessary
duplication.

For more direct support, use one of the following:

### `selects.with_or` {:#selects-with-or}

The
[with_or](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectswith_or){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing conditions directly inside a `select`:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = selects.with_or({
        (":config1", ":config2", ":config3"): [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

### `selects.config_setting_group` {:#selects-config-setting-or-group}


The
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing multiple `config_setting`s:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```


```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_or_2",
    match_any = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_or_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike `selects.with_or`, different targets can share `:config1_or_2` across
different attributes.

It's an error for multiple conditions to match unless one is an unambiguous
"specialization" of the others or they all resolve to the same value. See [here](#configurable-build-example) for details.

## AND chaining {:#and-chaining}

If you need a `select` branch to match when multiple conditions match, use the
[Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external} macro
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_and_2",
    match_all = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_and_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike OR chaining, existing `config_setting`s can't be directly `AND`ed
inside a `select`. You have to explicitly wrap them in a `config_setting_group`.

## Custom error messages {:#custom-error-messages}

By default, when no condition matches, the target the `select()` is attached to
fails with the error:

```sh
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //tools/cc_target_os:darwin
  //tools/cc_target_os:android
```

This can be customized with the [`no_match_error`](/reference/be/functions#select)
attribute:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select(
        {
            "//tools/cc_target_os:android": [":android_deps"],
            "//tools/cc_target_os:windows": [":windows_deps"],
        },
        no_match_error = "Please build with an Android or Windows toolchain",
    ),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_lib
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration: Please
build with an Android or Windows toolchain
```

## Rules compatibility {:#rules-compatibility}

Rule implementations receive the *resolved values* of configurable
attributes. For example, given:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

some_rule(
    name = "my_target",
    some_attr = select({
        ":foo_mode": [":foo"],
        ":bar_mode": [":bar"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp/my_target --define mode=foo
```

Rule implementation code sees `ctx.attr.some_attr` as `[":foo"]`.

Macros can accept `select()` clauses and pass them through to native
rules. But *they cannot directly manipulate them*. For example, there's no way
for a macro to convert

```python
select({"foo": "val"}, ...)
```

to

```python
select({"foo": "val_with_suffix"}, ...)
```

This is for two reasons.

First, macros that need to know which path a `select` will choose *cannot work*
because macros are evaluated in Bazel's [loading phase](/run/build#loading),
which occurs before flag values are known.
This is a core Bazel design restriction that's unlikely to change any time soon.

Second, macros that just need to iterate over *all* `select` paths, while
technically feasible, lack a coherent UI. Further design is necessary to change
this.

## Bazel query and cquery {:#query-and-cquery}

Bazel [`query`](/query/guide) operates over Bazel's
[loading phase](/reference/glossary#loading-phase).
This means it doesn't know what command line flags a target uses since those
flags aren't evaluated until later in the build (in the
[analysis phase](/reference/glossary#analysis-phase)).
So it can't determine which `select()` branches are chosen.

Bazel [`cquery`](/query/cquery) operates after Bazel's analysis phase, so it has
all this information and can accurately resolve `select()`s.

Consider:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
```
```python
# myapp/BUILD

string_flag(
    name = "dog_type",
    build_setting_default = "cat"
)

cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select({
        ":long": [":foo_dep"],
        ":short": [":bar_dep"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "long",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "dachshund"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "short",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "pug"},
)
```

`query` overapproximates `:my_lib`'s dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel query 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)'
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:foo_dep
//myapp:bar_dep
```

while `cquery` shows its exact dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)' --//myapp:dog_type=pug
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:bar_dep
```

## FAQ {:#faq}

### Why doesn't select() work in macros? {:#faq-select-macro}

select() *does* work in rules! See [Rules compatibility](#rules-compatibility) for
details.

The key issue this question usually means is that select() doesn't work in
*macros*. These are different than *rules*. See the
documentation on [rules](/extending/rules) and [macros](/extending/macros)
to understand the difference.
Here's an end-to-end example:

Define a rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

# Rule implementation: when an attribute is read, all select()s have already
# been resolved. So it looks like a plain old attribute just like any other.
def _impl(ctx):
    name = ctx.attr.name
    allcaps = ctx.attr.my_config_string.upper()  # This works fine on all values.
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)

# Rule declaration:
my_custom_bazel_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {"my_config_string": attr.string()},
)

# Macro declaration:
def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    allcaps = my_config_string.upper()  # This line won't work with select(s).
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)
```

Instantiate the rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_rule")
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_macro")

my_custom_bazel_rule(
    name = "happy_rule",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "second string",
    }),
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "happy_macro",
    my_config_string = "fixed string",
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "sad_macro",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "other string",
    }),
)
```

Building fails because `sad_macro` can't process the `select()`:

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:all
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
ERROR: error loading package 'myapp': Package 'myapp' contains errors.
```

Building succeeds when you comment out `sad_macro`:

```sh
# Comment out sad_macro so it doesn't mess up the build.
$ bazel build //myapp:all
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:5:3: My name is happy_macro with custom message: FIXED STRING.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/hi.bzl:15:3: My name is happy_rule with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

This is impossible to change because *by definition* macros are evaluated before
Bazel reads the build's command line flags. That means there isn't enough
information to evaluate select()s.

Macros can, however, pass `select()`s as opaque blobs to rules:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    print("Invoking macro " + name)
    my_custom_bazel_rule(
        name = name + "_as_target",
        my_config_string = my_config_string,
    )
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:sad_macro_less_sad
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:23:3: Invoking macro sad_macro_less_sad.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:15:3: My name is sad_macro_less_sad with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

### Why does select() always return true? {:#faq-boolean-select}

Because *macros* (but not rules) by definition
[can't evaluate `select()`s](#faq-select-macro), any attempt to do so
usually produces an error:

```sh
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
```

Booleans are a special case that fail silently, so you should be particularly
vigilant with them:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def my_boolean_macro(boolval):
  print("TRUE" if boolval else "FALSE")

$ cat myapp/BUILD
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_boolean_macro")
my_boolean_macro(
    boolval = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": True,
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": False,
    }),
)

$ bazel build //myapp:all --cpu=x86
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
$ bazel build //mypro:all --cpu=ppc
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
```

This happens because macros don't understand the contents of `select()`.
So what they're really evaluting is the `select()` object itself. According to
[Pythonic](https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html) design
standards, all objects aside from a very small number of exceptions
automatically return true.

### Can I read select() like a dict? {:#faq-inspectable-select}

Macros [can't](#faq-select-macro) evaluate select(s) because macros evaluate before
Bazel knows what the build's command line parameters are. Can they at least read
the `select()`'s dictionary to, for example, add a suffix to each value?

Conceptually this is possible, but [it isn't yet a Bazel feature](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8419).
What you *can* do today is prepare a straight dictionary, then feed it into a
`select()`:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
  for key in select_cmd.keys():
    select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
  native.genrule(
      name = name,
      outs = [name + ".out"],
      srcs = [],
      cmd = "echo " + select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})
        + " > $@"
  )

$ cat myapp/BUILD
selecty_genrule(
    name = "selecty",
    select_cmd = {
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "x86 mode",
    },
)

$ bazel build //testapp:selecty --cpu=x86 && cat bazel-genfiles/testapp/selecty.out
x86 mode WITH SUFFIX
```

If you'd like to support both `select()` and native types, you can do this:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
    cmd_suffix = ""
    if type(select_cmd) == "string":
        cmd_suffix = select_cmd + " WITH SUFFIX"
    elif type(select_cmd) == "dict":
        for key in select_cmd.keys():
            select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
        cmd_suffix = select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})

    native.genrule(
        name = name,
        outs = [name + ".out"],
        srcs = [],
        cmd = "echo " + cmd_suffix + "> $@",
    )
```

### Why doesn't select() work with bind()? {:#faq-select-bind}

First of all, do not use `bind()`. It is deprecated in favor of `alias()`.

The technical answer is that [`bind()`](/reference/be/workspace#bind) is a repo
rule, not a BUILD rule.

Repo rules do not have a specific configuration, and aren't evaluated in
the same way as BUILD rules. Therefore, a `select()` in a `bind()` can't
actually evaluate to any specific branch.

Instead, you should use [`alias()`](/reference/be/general#alias), with a `select()` in
the `actual` attribute, to perform this type of run-time determination. This
works correctly, since `alias()` is a BUILD rule, and is evaluated with a
specific configuration.

You can even have a `bind()` target point to an `alias()`, if needed.

```sh
$ cat WORKSPACE
workspace(name = "myapp")
bind(name = "openssl", actual = "//:ssl")
http_archive(name = "alternative", ...)
http_archive(name = "boringssl", ...)

$ cat BUILD
config_setting(
    name = "alt_ssl",
    define_values = {
        "ssl_library": "alternative",
    },
)

alias(
    name = "ssl",
    actual = select({
        "//:alt_ssl": "@alternative//:ssl",
        "//conditions:default": "@boringssl//:ssl",
    }),
)
```

With this setup, you can pass `--define ssl_library=alternative`, and any target
that depends on either `//:ssl` or `//external:ssl` will see the alternative
located at `@alternative//:ssl`.

But really, stop using `bind()`.

### Why doesn't my select() choose what I expect? {:#faq-select-choose-condition}

If `//myapp:foo` has a `select()` that doesn't choose the condition you expect,
use [cquery](/query/cquery) and `bazel config` to debug:

If `//myapp:foo` is the top-level target you're building, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery //myapp:foo <desired build flags>
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

If you're building some other target `//bar` that depends on
//myapp:foo somewhere in its subgraph, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'somepath(//bar, //myapp:foo)' <desired build flags>
//bar:bar   (3ag3193fee94a2)
//bar:intermediate_dep (12e23b9a2b534a)
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

The `(12e23b9a2b534a)` next to `//myapp:foo` is a *hash* of the
configuration that resolves `//myapp:foo`'s `select()`. You can inspect its
values with `bazel config`:

```sh
$ bazel config 12e23b9a2b534a
BuildConfigurationValue 12e23b9a2b534a
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.CoreOptions {
  cpu: darwin
  compilation_mode: fastbuild
  ...
}
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.rules.cpp.CppOptions {
  linkopt: [-Dfoo=bar]
  ...
}
...
```

Then compare this output against the settings expected by each `config_setting`.

`//myapp:foo` may exist in different configurations in the same build. See the
[cquery docs](/query/cquery) for guidance on using `somepath` to get the right
one.

Caution: To prevent restarting the Bazel server, invoke `bazel config` with the
same command line flags as the `bazel cquery`. The `config` command relies on
the configuration nodes from the still-running server of the previous command.

### Why doesn't `select()` work with platforms? {:#faq-select-platforms}

Bazel doesn't support configurable attributes checking whether a given platform
is the target platform because the semantics are unclear.

For example:

```py
platform(
    name = "x86_linux_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

In this `BUILD` file, which `select()` should be used if the target platform has both the
`@platforms//cpu:x86` and `@platforms//os:linux` constraints, but is **not** the
`:x86_linux_platform` defined here? The author of the `BUILD` file and the user
who defined the separate platform may have different ideas.

#### What should I do instead?

Instead, define a `config_setting` that matches **any** platform with
these constraints:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_x86_linux",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_x86_linux": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

This process defines specific semantics, making it clearer to users what
platforms meet the desired conditions.

#### What if I really, really want to `select` on the platform?

If your build requirements specifically require checking the platform, you
can flip the value of the `--platforms` flag in a `config_setting`:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_specific_x86_linux_platform",
    values = {
        "platforms": ["//package:x86_linux_platform"],
    },
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_specific_x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

The Bazel team doesn't endorse doing this; it overly constrains your build and
confuses users when the expected condition does not match.

<p class="lead">Fast iterative development for Android</p>

This page describes how `bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development
for Android much faster. It describes the benefits of this approach versus the
challenges of the traditional app install method.

## Summary {:#summary}

To install small changes to an Android app very quickly, do the following:

 1. Find the `android_binary` rule of the app you want to install.
 2. Disable Proguard by removing the `proguard_specs` attribute.
 3. Set the `multidex` attribute to `native`.
 4. Set the `dex_shards` attribute to `10`.
 5. Connect your device running ART (not Dalvik) over USB and enable USB
    debugging on it.
 6. Run `bazel mobile-install :your_target`. App startup will be a little
    slower than usual.
 7. Edit the code or Android resources.
 8. Run `bazel mobile-install --incremental :your_target`.
 9. Enjoy not having to wait a lot.

Some command line options to Bazel that may be useful:

 - `--adb` tells Bazel which adb binary to use
 - `--adb_arg` can be used to  add extra arguments to the command line of `adb`.
   One useful application of this is to select which device you want to install
   to if you have multiple devices connected to your workstation:
   `bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=<SERIAL> :your_target`
 - `--start_app` automatically starts the app

When in doubt, look at the
[example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/examples/android){: .external}
or [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss){: .external}.

## Introduction {:#introduction}

One of the most important attributes of a developer's toolchain is speed: there
is a world of difference between changing the code and seeing it run within a
second and having to wait minutes, sometimes hours, before you get any feedback
on whether your changes do what you expect them to.

Unfortunately, the traditional Android toolchain for building an .apk entails
many monolithic, sequential steps and all of these have to be done in order to
build an Android app. At Google, waiting five minutes to build a single-line
change was not unusual on larger projects like Google Maps.

`bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development for Android much faster by
using a combination of change pruning, work sharding, and clever manipulation of
Android internals, all without changing any of your app's code.

## Problems with traditional app installation {:#problems-app-install}

Building an Android app has some issues, including:

- Dexing. By default, "dx" is invoked exactly once in the build and it does not
know how to reuse work from previous builds: it dexes every method again, even
though only one method was changed.

- Uploading data to the device. adb does not use the full bandwidth of a USB 2.0
connection, and larger apps can take a lot of time to upload. The entire app is
uploaded, even if only small parts have changed, for example, a resource or a
single method, so this can be a major bottleneck.

- Compilation to native code. Android L introduced ART, a new Android runtime,
which compiles apps ahead-of-time rather than compiling them just-in-time like
Dalvik. This makes apps much faster at the cost of longer installation
time. This is a good tradeoff for users because they typically install an app
once and use it many times, but results in slower development where an app is
installed many times and each version is run at most a handful of times.

## The approach of `bazel mobile-install` {:#approach-mobile-install}

`bazel mobile-install `makes the following improvements:

 - Sharded dexing. After building the app's Java code, Bazel shards the class
   files into approximately equal-sized parts and invokes `dx` separately on
   them. `dx` is not invoked on shards that did not change since the last build.

 - Incremental file transfer. Android resources, .dex files, and native
   libraries are removed from the main .apk and are stored in under a separate
   mobile-install directory. This makes it possible to update code and Android
   resources independently without reinstalling the whole app. Thus,
   transferring the files takes less time and only the .dex files that have
   changed are recompiled on-device.

 - Loading parts of the app from outside the .apk. A tiny stub application is
   put into the .apk that loads Android resources, Java code and native code
   from the on-device mobile-install directory, then transfers control to the
   actual app. This is all transparent to the app, except in a few corner cases
   described below.

### Sharded Dexing {:#sharded-dexing}

Sharded dexing is reasonably straightforward: once the .jar files are built, a
[tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/ziputils/DexMapper.java){: .external}
shards them into separate .jar files of approximately equal size, then invokes
`dx` on those that were changed since the previous build. The logic that
determines which shards to dex is not specific to Android: it just uses the
general change pruning algorithm of Bazel.

The first version of the sharding algorithm simply ordered the .class files
alphabetically, then cut the list up into equal-sized parts, but this proved to
be suboptimal: if a class was added or removed (even a nested or an anonymous
one), it would cause all the classes alphabetically after it to shift by one,
resulting in dexing those shards again. Thus, it was decided to shard Java
packages rather than individual classes. Of course, this still results in
dexing many shards if a new package is added or removed, but that is much less
frequent than adding or removing a single class.

The number of shards is controlled by the BUILD file (using the
`android_binary.dex_shards` attribute). In an ideal world, Bazel would
automatically determine how many shards are best, but Bazel currently must know
the set of actions (for example, commands to be executed during the build) before
executing any of them, so it cannot determine the optimal number of shards
because it doesn't know how many Java classes there will eventually be in the
app. Generally speaking, the more shards, the faster the build and the
installation will be, but the slower app startup becomes, because the dynamic
linker has to do more work. The sweet spot is usually between 10 and 50 shards.

### Incremental file transfer {:#incremental-file-transfer}

After building the app, the next step is to install it, preferably with the
least effort possible. Installation consists of the following steps:

 1. Installing the .apk (typically using `adb install`)
 2. Uploading the .dex files, Android resources, and native libraries to the
    mobile-install directory

There is not much incrementality in the first step: the app is either installed
or not. Bazel currently relies on the user to indicate if it should do this step
through the `--incremental` command line option because it cannot determine in
all cases if it is necessary.

In the second step, the app's files from the build are compared to an on-device
manifest file that lists which app files are on the device and their
checksums. Any new files are uploaded to the device, any files that have changed
are updated, and any files that have been removed are deleted from the
device. If the manifest is not present, it is assumed that every file needs to
be uploaded.

Note that it is possible to fool the incremental installation algorithm by
changing a file on the device, but not its checksum in the manifest. This could
have been safeguarded against by computing the checksum of the files on the
device, but this was deemed to be not worth the increase in installation time.

### The Stub application {:#stub-app}

The stub application is where the magic to load the dexes, native code and
Android resources from the on-device `mobile-install` directory happens.

The actual loading is implemented by subclassing `BaseDexClassLoader` and is a
reasonably well-documented technique. This happens before any of the app's
classes are loaded, so that any application classes that are in the apk can be
placed in the on-device `mobile-install` directory so that they can be updated
without `adb install`.

This needs to happen before any of the
classes of the app are loaded, so that no application class needs to be in the
.apk which would mean that changes to those classes would require a full
re-install.

This is accomplished by replacing the `Application` class specified in
`AndroidManifest.xml` with the
[stub application](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/incrementaldeployment/StubApplication.java){: .external}. This
takes control when the app is started, and tweaks the class loader and the
resource manager appropriately at the earliest moment (its constructor) using
Java reflection on the internals of the Android framework.

Another thing the stub application does is to copy the native libraries
installed by mobile-install to another location. This is necessary because the
dynamic linker needs the `X` bit to be set on the files, which is not possible to
do for any location accessible by a non-root `adb`.

Once all these things are done, the stub application then instantiates the
actual `Application` class, changing all references to itself to the actual
application within the Android framework.

## Results {:#results}

### Performance {:#performance}

In general, `bazel mobile-install` results in a 4x to 10x speedup of building
and installing large apps after a small change.

The following numbers were computed for a few Google products:

<img src="/docs/images/mobile-install-performance.svg"/>

This, of course, depends on the nature of the change: recompilation after
changing a base library takes more time.

### Limitations {:#limitations}

The tricks the stub application plays don't work in every case.
The following cases highlight where it does not work as expected:

 - When `Context` is cast to the `Application` class in
   `ContentProvider#onCreate()`. This method is called during application
   startup before we have a chance to replace the instance of the `Application`
   class, therefore, `ContentProvider` will still reference the stub application
   instead of the real one. Arguably, this is not a bug since you are not
   supposed to downcast `Context` like this, but this seems to happen in a few
   apps at Google.

 - Resources installed by `bazel mobile-install` are only available from within
   the app. If resources are accessed by other apps via
   `PackageManager#getApplicationResources()`, these resources will be from the
   last non-incremental install.

 - Devices that aren't running ART. While the stub application works well on
   Froyo and later, Dalvik has a bug that makes it think that the app is
   incorrect if its code is distributed over multiple .dex files in certain
   cases, for example, when Java annotations are used in a
   [specific](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78144){: .external}
   way. As long as your app doesn't tickle these bugs, it should work with Dalvik,
   too (note, however, that support for old Android versions isn't exactly our
   focus)

# Using the Android Native Development Kit with Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, please start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

## Overview {:#overview}

Bazel can run in many different build configurations, including several that use
the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) toolchain. This means that normal
`cc_library` and `cc_binary` rules can be compiled for Android directly within
Bazel. Bazel accomplishes this by using the `android_ndk_repository` repository
rule.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Please ensure that you have installed the Android SDK and NDK.

To set up the SDK and NDK, add the following snippet to your `WORKSPACE`:

```python
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidsdk".
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.
)

android_ndk_repository(
    name = "androidndk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidndk".
    path = "/path/to/ndk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable is set.
)
```

For more information about the `android_ndk_repository` rule, see the [Build
Encyclopedia entry](/reference/be/android#android_ndk_repository).

If you're using a recent version of the Android NDK (r22 and beyond), use the
Starlark implementation of `android_ndk_repository`.
Follow the instructions in
[its README](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk).

## Quick start {:#quick-start}

To build C++ for Android, simply add `cc_library` dependencies to your
`android_binary` or `android_library` rules.

For example, given the following `BUILD` file for an Android app:

```python
# In <project>/app/src/main/BUILD.bazel

cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
)

android_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["java/com/example/android/bazel/MainActivity.java"],
    resource_files = glob(["res/**/*"]),
    custom_package = "com.example.android.bazel",
    manifest = "LibraryManifest.xml",
    deps = [":jni_lib"],
)

android_binary(
    name = "app",
    deps = [":lib"],
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
)
```

This `BUILD` file results in the following target graph:

![Example results](/docs/images/android_ndk.png "Build graph results")

**Figure 1.** Build graph of Android project with cc_library dependencies.

To build the app, simply run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //app/src/main:app
```

The `bazel build` command compiles the Java files, Android resource files, and
`cc_library` rules, and packages everything into an APK:

```posix-terminal
$ zipinfo -1 bazel-bin/app/src/main/app.apk
nativedeps
lib/armeabi-v7a/libapp.so
classes.dex
AndroidManifest.xml
...
res/...
...
META-INF/CERT.SF
META-INF/CERT.RSA
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

Bazel compiles all of the cc_libraries into a single shared object (`.so`) file,
targeted for the `armeabi-v7a` ABI by default. To change this or build for
multiple ABIs at the same time, see the section on [configuring the target
ABI](#configuring-target-abi).

## Example setup {:#example-setup}

This example is available in the [Bazel examples
repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/master/android/ndk){: .external}.

In the `BUILD.bazel` file, three targets are defined with the `android_binary`,
`android_library`, and `cc_library` rules.

The `android_binary` top-level target builds the APK.

The `cc_library` target contains a single C++ source file with a JNI function
implementation:

```c++
#include <jni.h>
#include <string>

extern "C"
JNIEXPORT jstring

JNICALL
Java_com_example_android_bazel_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv *env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    std::string hello = "Hello from C++";
    return env->NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
}
```

The `android_library` target specifies the Java sources, resource files, and the
dependency on a `cc_library` target. For this example, `MainActivity.java` loads
the shared object file `libapp.so`, and defines the method signature for the JNI
function:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("app");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       // ...
    }

    public native String stringFromJNI();

}
```

Note: The name of the native library is derived from the name of the top
level `android_binary` target. In this example, it is `app`.

## Configuring the target ABI {:#configuring-target-abi}

To configure the target ABI, use the `--android_platforms` flag as follows:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}comma-separated list of platforms{{ "</var>" }}
```

Just like the `--platforms` flag, the values passed to `--android_platforms` are
the labels of [`platform`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#platform)
targets, using standard constraint values to describe your device.

For example, for an Android device with a 64-bit ARM processor, you'd define
your platform like this:

```py
platform(
    name = "android_arm64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:android",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm64",
    ],
)
```

Every Android `platform` should use the [`@platforms//os:android`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms/blob/33a3b209f94856193266871b1545054afb90bb28/os/BUILD#L36)
OS constraint. To migrate the CPU constraint, check this chart:

CPU Value     | Platform
------------- | ------------------------------------------
`armeabi-v7a` | `@platforms//cpu:armv7`
`arm64-v8a`   | `@platforms//cpu:arm64`
`x86`         | `@platforms//cpu:x86_32`
`x86_64`      | `@platforms//cpu:x86_64`

And, of course, for a multi-architecture APK, you pass multiple labels, for
example: `--android_platforms=//:arm64,//:x86_64` (assuming you defined those in
your top-level `BUILD.bazel` file).

Bazel is unable to select a default Android platform, so one must be defined and
specified with `--android_platforms`.

Depending on the NDK revision and Android API level, the following ABIs are
available:

| NDK revision | ABIs                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 16 and lower | armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, mips64, x86, x86\_64 |
| 17 and above | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86\_64                        |

See [the NDK docs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html){: .external}
for more information on these ABIs.

Multi-ABI Fat APKs are not recommended for release builds since they increase
the size of the APK, but can be useful for development and QA builds.

## Selecting a C++ standard {:#selecting-c-standard}

Use the following flags to build according to a C++ standard:

| C++ Standard | Flag                    |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| C++98        | Default, no flag needed |
| C++11        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++11`   |
| C++14        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++14`   |
| C++17        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++17`   |

For example:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --cxxopt=-std=c++11
```

Read more about passing compiler and linker flags with `--cxxopt`, `--copt`, and
`--linkopt` in the [User Manual](/docs/user-manual#cxxopt).

Compiler and linker flags can also be specified as attributes in `cc_library`
using `copts` and `linkopts`. For example:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
    copts = ["-std=c++11"],
    linkopts = ["-ldl"], # link against libdl
)
```

## Building a `cc_library` for Android without using `android_binary` {:#cclibrary-android}

To build a standalone `cc_binary` or `cc_library` for Android without using an
`android_binary`, use the `--platforms` flag.

For example, assuming you have defined Android platforms in
`my/platforms/BUILD`:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target \
      --platforms=//my/platforms:x86_64
```

With this approach, the entire build tree is affected.

Note: All of the targets on the command line must be compatible with
building for Android when specifying these flags, which may make it difficult to
use [Bazel wild-cards](/run/build#specifying-build-targets) like
`/...` and `:all`.

These flags can be put into a `bazelrc` config (one for each ABI), in
`{{ "<var>" }}project{{ "</var>" }}/.bazelrc`:

```
common:android_x86 --platforms=//my/platforms:x86

common:android_armeabi-v7a --platforms=//my/platforms:armeabi-v7a

# In general
common:android_<abi> --platforms=//my/platforms:<abi>
```

Then, to build a `cc_library` for `x86` for example, run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target --config=android_x86
```

In general, use this method for low-level targets (like `cc_library`) or when
you know exactly what you're building; rely on the automatic configuration
transitions from `android_binary` for high-level targets where you're expecting
to build a lot of targets you don't control.

# C++ Toolchain Configuration

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

## Overview {:#overview}

To invoke the compiler with the right options, Bazel needs some knowledge about
the compiler internals, such as include directories and important flags.
In other words, Bazel needs a simplified model of the compiler to understand its
workings.

Bazel needs to know the following:

* Whether the compiler supports thinLTO, modules, dynamic linking, or PIC
  (position independent code).
* Paths to the required tools such as gcc, ld, ar, objcopy, and so on.
* The built-in system include directories. Bazel needs these to validate that
  all headers that were included in the source file were properly declared in
  the `BUILD` file.
* The default sysroot.
* Which flags to use for compilation, linking, archiving.
* Which flags to use for the supported compilation modes (opt, dbg, fastbuild).
* Make variables specifically required by the compiler.

If the compiler has support for multiple architectures, Bazel needs to configure
them separately.

[`CcToolchainConfigInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/CcToolchainConfigInfo) is a provider that provides the necessary level of
granularity for configuring the behavior of Bazel's C++ rules. By default,
Bazel automatically configures `CcToolchainConfigInfo` for your build, but you
have the option to configure it manually. For that, you need a Starlark rule
that provides the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` and you need to point the
[`toolchain_config`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain.toolchain_config) attribute of the
[`cc_toolchain`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain) to your rule.
You can create the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` by calling
[`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info()`](/rules/lib/toplevel/cc_common#create_cc_toolchain_config_info).
You can find Starlark constructors for all structs you'll need in the process in
[`@rules_cc//cc:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/blob/master/cc/cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl){: .external}.


When a C++ target enters the analysis phase, Bazel selects the appropriate
`cc_toolchain` target based on the `BUILD` file, and obtains the
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider from the target specified in the
`cc_toolchain.toolchain_config` attribute. The `cc_toolchain` target
passes this information to the C++ target through a `CcToolchainProvider`.

For example, a compile or link action, instantiated by a rule such as
`cc_binary` or `cc_library`, needs the following information:

*   The compiler or linker to use
*   Command-line flags for the compiler/linker
*   Configuration flags passed through the `--copt/--linkopt` options
*   Environment variables
*   Artifacts needed in the sandbox in which the action executes

All of the above information except the artifacts required in the sandbox is
specified in the Starlark target that the `cc_toolchain` points to.

The artifacts to be shipped to the sandbox are declared in the `cc_toolchain`
target. For example, with the `cc_toolchain.linker_files` attribute you can
specify the linker binary and toolchain libraries to ship into the sandbox.

## Toolchain selection {:#toolchain-selection}

The toolchain selection logic operates as follows:

1.  User specifies a `cc_toolchain_suite` target in the `BUILD` file and points
    Bazel to the target using the
    [`--crosstool_top` option](/docs/user-manual#flag--crosstool_top).

2.  The `cc_toolchain_suite` target references multiple toolchains. The
    values of the `--cpu` and `--compiler` flags determine which of those
    toolchains is selected, either based only on the `--cpu` flag value, or
    based on a joint `--cpu | --compiler` value. The selection process is as
    follows:

  * If the `--compiler` option is specified, Bazel selects the
        corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
        attribute with `--cpu | --compiler`. If Bazel does not find
        a corresponding entry, it throws an error.

  * If the `--compiler` option is not specified, Bazel selects
    the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
    attribute with just `--cpu`.

  * If no flags are specified, Bazel inspects the host system and selects a
    `--cpu` value based on its findings. See the
    [inspection mechanism code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/1b73bc37e184e71651eb631223dcce321ba16211:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/AutoCpuConverter.java).

Once a toolchain has been selected, corresponding `feature` and `action_config`
objects in the Starlark rule govern the configuration of the build (that is,
items described later). These messages allow the implementation of
fully fledged C++ features in Bazel without modifying the
Bazel binary. C++ rules support multiple unique actions documented in detail
[in the Bazel source code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/4f547a7ea86df80e4c76145ffdbb0c8b75ba3afa:tools/build_defs/cc/action_names.bzl).

## Features {:#features}

A feature is an entity that requires command-line flags, actions,
constraints on the execution environment, or dependency alterations. A feature
can be something as simple as allowing `BUILD` files to select configurations of
flags, such as `treat_warnings_as_errors`, or interact with the C++ rules and
include new compile actions and inputs to the compilation, such as
`header_modules` or `thin_lto`.

Ideally, `CcToolchainConfigInfo` contains a list of features, where each
feature consists of one or more flag groups, each defining a list of flags
that apply to specific Bazel actions.

A feature is specified by name, which allows full decoupling of the Starlark
rule configuration from Bazel releases. In other words, a Bazel release does not
affect the behavior of `CcToolchainConfigInfo` configurations as long as those
configurations do not require the use of new features.

A feature is enabled in one of the following ways:

*  The feature's `enabled` field is set to `true`.
*  Bazel or the rule owner explicitly enable it.
*  The user enables it through the `--feature` Bazel option or `features` rule
   attribute.

Features can have interdependencies, depend on command line flags, `BUILD` file
settings, and other variables.

### Feature relationships {:#feature-relationships}

Dependencies are typically managed directly with Bazel, which simply enforces
the requirements and manages conflicts intrinsic to the nature of the features
defined in the build. The toolchain specification allows for more granular
constraints for use directly within the Starlark rule that govern feature
support and expansion. These are:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Constraint</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>requires = [
   feature_set (features = [
       'feature-name-1',
       'feature-name-2'
   ]),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Feature-level. The feature is supported only if the specified required
       features are enabled. For example, when a feature is only supported in
       certain build modes (<code>opt</code>, <code>dbg</code>, or
       <code>fastbuild</code>). If `requires` contains multiple `feature_set`s
       the feature is supported if any of the `feature_set`s is satisfied
       (when all specified features are enabled).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>implies = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. This feature implies the specified feature(s).
       Enabling a feature also implicitly enables all features implied by it
       (that is, it functions recursively).</p>
       <p>Also provides the ability to factor common subsets of functionality out of
       a set of features, such as the common parts of sanitizers. Implied
       features cannot be disabled.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>provides = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. Indicates that this feature is one of several mutually
       exclusive alternate features. For example, all of the sanitizers could
       specify <code>provides = ["sanitizer"]</code>.</p>
       <p>This improves error handling by listing the alternatives if the user asks
       for two or more mutually exclusive features at once.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>with_features = [
  with_feature_set(
    features = ['feature-1'],
    not_features = ['feature-2'],
  ),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Flag set-level. A feature can specify multiple flag sets with multiple.
     When <code>with_features</code> is specified, the flag set will only expand
     to the build command if there is at least one <code>with_feature_set</code>
     for which all of the features in the specified <code>features</code> set
     are enabled, and all the features specified in <code>not_features</code>
     set are disabled.
     If <code>with_features</code> is not specified, the flag set will be
     applied unconditionally for every action specified.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Actions {:#actions}

Actions provide the flexibility to modify the circumstances under
which an action executes without assuming how the action will be run. An
`action_config` specifies the tool binary that an action invokes, while a
`feature` specifies the configuration (flags) that determine how that tool
behaves when the action is invoked.

[Features](#features) reference actions to signal which Bazel actions
they affect since actions can modify the Bazel action graph. The
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider contains actions that have flags and tools
associated with them, such as `c++-compile`. Flags are assigned to each action
by associating them with a feature.

Each action name represents a single type of action performed by Bazel, such as
compiling or linking. There is, however, a many-to-one relationship between
actions and Bazel action types, where a Bazel action type refers to a Java class
that implements an action (such as `CppCompileAction`). In particular, the
"assembler actions" and "compiler actions" in the table below are
`CppCompileAction`, while the link actions are `CppLinkAction`.

### Assembler actions {:#assembler-actions}

   <td>ThinLTO action generating global index.

  </tr>
</table>

## Using action_config {:#using-action-config}

The `action_config` is a Starlark struct that describes a Bazel
action by specifying the tool (binary) to invoke during the action and sets of
flags, defined by features. These flags apply constraints to the action's
execution.

The `action_config()` constructor has the following parameters:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Attribute</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>action_name</code>
   </td>
    <td>The Bazel action to which this action corresponds.
        Bazel uses this attribute to discover per-action tool and execution
        requirements.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>tools</code>
   </td>
   <td>The executable to invoke. The tool applied to the action will be the
       first tool in the list with a feature set that matches the feature
       configuration. Default value must be provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>flag_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of flags that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a
       feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>env_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of environment constraints that applies to a group of actions.
       Same as for a feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

An `action_config` can require and imply other features and
<code>action_config</code>s as dictated by the
[feature relationships](#feature-relationships) described earlier. This behavior
is similar to that of a feature.

The last two attributes are redundant against the corresponding attributes on
features and are included because some Bazel actions require certain flags or
environment variables and the goal is to avoid unnecessary `action_config`+`feature`
pairs. Typically, sharing a single feature across multiple `action_config`s is
preferred.

You can not define more than one `action_config` with the same `action_name`
within the same toolchain. This prevents ambiguity in tool paths
and enforces the intention behind `action_config` - that an action's properties
are clearly described in a single place in the toolchain.

### Using tool constructor {:#using-tool-constructor}

An`action_config` can specify a set of tools via its `tools` parameter.
The `tool()` constructor takes in the following parameters:


<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>path</code>
   </td>
   <td>Path to the tool in question (relative to the current location).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>with_features</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of feature sets out of which at least one must be satisfied
       for this tool to apply.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For a given `action_config`, only a single `tool` applies
its tool path and execution requirements to the Bazel action. A tool is selected
by iterating through the `tools` attribute on an `action_config` until a tool
with a `with_feature` set matching the feature configuration is found
(see [Feature relationships](#feature-relationships) earlier on this page
for more information). You should end your tool lists with a default
tool that corresponds to an empty feature configuration.

### Example usage {:#example-usage}

Features and actions can be used together to implement Bazel actions
with diverse cross-platform semantics. For example, debug symbol generation on
macOS requires generating symbols in the compile action, then invoking a
specialized tool during the link action to create  compressed dsym archive, and
then decompressing that archive to produce the application bundle and `.plist`
files consumable by Xcode.

With Bazel, this process can instead be implemented as follows, with
`unbundle-debuginfo` being a Bazel action:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            action_name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    with_features = [
                        with_feature(features=["generate-debug-symbols"]),
                    ],
                    path = "toolchain/mac/ld-with-dsym-packaging",
                ),
                tool (path = "toolchain/mac/ld"),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature(
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set (
                    actions = [
                        ACTION_NAMES.c_compile,
                        ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile
                    ],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-g"],
                        ),
                    ],
                )
            ],
            implies = ["unbundle-debuginfo"],
       ),
    ]


This same feature can be implemented entirely differently for Linux, which uses
`fission`, or for Windows, which produces `.pdb` files. For example, the
implementation for `fission`-based debug symbol generation might look as
follows:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    path = "toolchain/bin/gcc",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature (
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            requires = [with_feature_set(features = ["dbg"])],
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-gsplit-dwarf"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-Wl", "--gdb-index"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
          ],
        ),
    ]


### Flag groups {:#flag-groups}

`CcToolchainConfigInfo` allows you to bundle flags into groups that serve a
specific purpose. You can specify a flag within using pre-defined variables
within the flag value, which the compiler expands when adding the flag to the
build command. For example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["%{output_execpath}"],
    )


In this case, the contents of the flag will be replaced by the output file path
of the action.

Flag groups are expanded to the build command in the order in which they appear
in the list, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

For flags that need to repeat with different values when added to the build
command, the flag group can iterate variables of type `list`. For example, the
variable `include_path` of type `list`:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I<path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list. All
flags (or `flag_group`s) in the body of a flag group declaration are expanded as
a unit. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I", "%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I <path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list.

A variable can repeat multiple times. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-iprefix=%{include_paths}", "-isystem=%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to:

    -iprefix=<inc0> -isystem=<inc0> -iprefix=<inc1> -isystem=<inc1>

Variables can correspond to structures accessible using dot-notation. For
example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.name}"],
    )

Structures can be nested and may also contain sequences. To prevent name clashes
and to be explicit, you must specify the full path through the fields. For
example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
            ),
        ],
    )


### Conditional expansion {:#conditional-expansion}

Flag groups support conditional expansion based on the presence of a particular
variable or its field using the `expand_if_available`, `expand_if_not_available`,
`expand_if_true`, `expand_if_false`, or `expand_if_equal` attributes. For example:


    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--whole_archive"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--no_whole_archive"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
        ],
    )

Note: The `--whole_archive` and `--no_whole_archive` options are added to
the build command only when a currently iterated library has an
`is_whole_archive` field.

    <li>Adds <code>compiler_output_flags</code> (if not present) feature to the bottom of the toolchain</li>
  </ul>
</p>

This is a long list of features. The plan is to get rid of them once
[Crosstool in Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380){: .external} is
done. For the curious reader see the implementation in
[CppActionConfigs](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CppActionConfigs.java?q=cppactionconfigs&ss=bazel),
and for production toolchains consider adding `no_legacy_features` to make
the toolchain more standalone.

# Android Build Performance

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains information on optimizing build performance for Android
apps specifically. For general build performance optimization with Bazel, see
[Optimizing Performance](/rules/performance).

## Recommended flags {:#recommended-flags}

The flags are in the
[`bazelrc` configuration syntax](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-syntax-semantics), so
they can be pasted directly into a `bazelrc` file and invoked with
`--config=<configuration_name>` on the command line.

**Profiling performance**

Bazel writes a JSON trace profile by default to a file called
`command.profile.gz` in Bazel's output base.
See the [JSON Profile documentation](/rules/performance#performance-profiling) for
how to read and interact with the profile.

**Persistent workers for Android build actions**.

A subset of Android build actions has support for
[persistent workers](https://blog.bazel.build/2015/12/10/java-workers.html).

These actions' mnemonics are:

*   DexBuilder
*   Javac
*   Desugar
*   AaptPackage
*   AndroidResourceParser
*   AndroidResourceValidator
*   AndroidResourceCompiler
*   RClassGenerator
*   AndroidResourceLink
*   AndroidAapt2
*   AndroidAssetMerger
*   AndroidResourceMerger
*   AndroidCompiledResourceMerger

Enabling workers can result in better build performance by saving on JVM
startup costs from invoking each of these tools, but at the cost of increased
memory usage on the system by persisting them.

To enable workers for these actions, apply these flags with
`--config=android_workers` on the command line:

```
build:android_workers --strategy=DexBuilder=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Javac=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Desugar=worker

# A wrapper flag for these resource processing actions:
# - AndroidResourceParser
# - AndroidResourceValidator
# - AndroidResourceCompiler
# - RClassGenerator
# - AndroidResourceLink
# - AndroidAapt2
# - AndroidAssetMerger
# - AndroidResourceMerger
# - AndroidCompiledResourceMerger
build:android_workers --persistent_android_resource_processor
```

The default number of persistent workers created per action is `4`. We have
[measured improved build performance](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8586#issuecomment-500070549){: .external}
by capping the number of instances for each action to `1` or `2`, although this
may vary depending on the system Bazel is running on, and the project being
built.

To cap the number of instances for an action, apply these flags:

```
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=DexBuilder=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Javac=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Desugar=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=AaptPackage=2
# .. and so on for each action you're interested in.
```

**Using AAPT2**

[`aapt2`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2){: .external} has improved
performance over `aapt` and also creates smaller APKs. To use `aapt2`, use the
`--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or set `aapt2` on the `aapt_version` on
`android_binary` and `android_local_test`.

**SSD optimizations**

The `--experimental_multi_threaded_digest` flag is useful for optimizing digest
computation on SSDs.

# Commands and Options

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page covers the options that are available with various Bazel commands,
such as `bazel build`, `bazel run`, and `bazel test`. This page is a companion
to the list of Bazel's commands in [Build with Bazel](/run/build).

## Target syntax {:#target-syntax}

Some commands, like `build` or `test`, can operate on a list of targets. They
use a syntax more flexible than labels, which is documented in
[Specifying targets to build](/run/build#specifying-build-targets).

## Options {:#build-options}

The following sections describe the options available during a
build. When `--long` is used on a help command, the on-line
help messages provide summary information about the meaning, type and
default value for each option.

Most options can only be specified once. When specified multiple times, the
last instance wins. Options that can be specified multiple times are
identified in the on-line help with the text 'may be used multiple times'.

### Package location {:#package-location}

#### `--package_path` {:#package-path}

**WARNING:** The `--package_path` option is deprecated. Bazel prefers packages
in the main repository to be under the workspace root.

This option specifies the set of directories that are searched to
find the BUILD file for a given package.

Bazel finds its packages by searching the package path. This is a colon
separated ordered list of bazel directories, each being the root of a
partial source tree.

_To specify a custom package path_ using the `--package_path` option:

<pre>
  % bazel build --package_path %workspace%:/some/other/root
</pre>

Package path elements may be specified in three formats:

1.  If the first character is `/`, the path is absolute.
2.  If the path starts with `%workspace%`, the path is taken relative
    to the nearest enclosing bazel directory.
    For instance, if your working directory
    is `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, then the
    string `%workspace%` in the package-path is expanded
    to `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel`.
3.  Anything else is taken relative to the working directory.
    This is usually not what you mean to do,
    and may behave unexpectedly if you use Bazel from directories below the bazel workspace.
    For instance, if you use the package-path element `.`,
    and then cd into the directory
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, packages
    will be resolved from the
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo` directory.

If you use a non-default package path, specify it in your
[Bazel configuration file](/run/bazelrc) for convenience.

_Bazel doesn't require any packages to be in the
current directory_, so you can do a build from an empty bazel
workspace if all the necessary packages can be found somewhere else
on the package path.

Example: Building from an empty client

<pre>
  % mkdir -p foo/bazel
  % cd foo/bazel
  % touch MODULE.bazel
  % bazel build --package_path /some/other/path //foo
</pre>

#### `--deleted_packages` {:flag--deleted_packages}

This option specifies a comma-separated list of packages which Bazel
should consider deleted, and not attempt to load from any directory
on the package path. This can be used to simulate the deletion of packages without
actually deleting them. This option can be passed multiple times, in which case
the individual lists are concatenated.

### Error checking {:#error-checking}

These options control Bazel's error-checking and/or warnings.

#### `--[no]check_visibility` {:#check-visibility}

If this option is set to false, visibility checks are demoted to warnings.
The default value of this option is true, so that by default, visibility
checking is done.

#### `--output_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-filter}

The `--output_filter` option will only show build and compilation
warnings for targets that match the regular expression. If a target does not
match the given regular expression and its execution succeeds, its standard
output and standard error are thrown away.

Here are some typical values for this option:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//(first/project|second/project):'`</td>
    <td>Show the output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//((?!(first/bad_project|second/bad_project):).)*$'`</td>
    <td>Don't show output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=`</td>
    <td>Show everything.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=DONT_MATCH_ANYTHING`</td>
    <td>Show nothing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tool flags {:#tool-flags}

These options control which options Bazel will pass to other tools.

#### `--copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler.
The argument will be passed to the compiler whenever it is invoked
for preprocessing, compiling, and/or assembling C, C++, or
assembler code. It will not be passed when linking.

This option can be used multiple times. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-g0" --copt="-fpic" //foo
</pre>

will compile the `foo` library without debug tables, generating
position-independent code.

Note: Changing `--copt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected object files. Also note that copts values listed in specific
cc_library or cc_binary build rules will be placed on the compiler command line
_after_ these options.

Warning: C++-specific options (such as `-fno-implicit-templates`)
should be specified in `--cxxopt`, not in
`--copt`. Likewise, C-specific options (such as -Wstrict-prototypes)
should be specified in `--conlyopt`, not in `copt`.
Similarly, compiler options that only have an
effect at link time (such as `-l`) should be specified in
`--linkopt`, not in `--copt`.

#### `--host_copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--copt`](#copt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-conlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--conlyopt`](#cconlyopt) option, but applies only
to the exec configuration.

#### `--host_cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C++ source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--cxxopt`](#cxxopt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the linker for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--linkopt`](#linkopt) option, but applies only to
the exec configuration.

#### `--conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cconlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when compiling C source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C compilation,
not to C++ compilation or linking. So you can pass C-specific options
(such as `-Wno-pointer-sign`) using `--conlyopt`.

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when
compiling C++ source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C++ compilation,
not to C compilation or linking. So you can pass C++-specific options
(such as `-fpermissive` or `-fno-implicit-templates`) using `--cxxopt`.

For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --cxxopt="-fpermissive" --cxxopt="-Wno-error" //foo/cruddy_code
</pre>

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when linking.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to linking,
not to compilation. So you can pass compiler options that only make sense
at link time (such as `-lssp` or `-Wl,--wrap,abort`)
using `--linkopt`. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-fmudflap" --linkopt="-lmudflap" //foo/buggy_code
</pre>

Build rules can also specify link options in their attributes. This option's
settings always take precedence. Also see
[cc_library.linkopts](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.linkopts).

#### `--strip (always|never|sometimes)` {:#strip}

This option determines whether Bazel will strip debugging information from
all binaries and shared libraries, by invoking the linker with the `-Wl,--strip-debug` option.
`--strip=always` means always strip debugging information.
`--strip=never` means never strip debugging information.
The default value of `--strip=sometimes` means strip if the `--compilation_mode`
is `fastbuild`.

<pre>
  % bazel build --strip=always //foo:bar
</pre>

will compile the target while stripping debugging information from all generated
binaries.

Note: If you want debugging information, it's not enough to disable stripping;
you also need to make sure that the debugging information was generated by the
compiler, which you can do by using either `-c dbg` or `--copt -g`.

Bazel's `--strip` option corresponds with ld's `--strip-debug` option:
it only strips debugging information. If for some reason you want to strip _all_ symbols,
not just _debug_ symbols, you would need to use ld's `--strip-all` option,
which you can do by passing `--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all` to Bazel. Also be
aware that setting Bazel's `--strip` flag will override
`--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all`, so you should only set one or the other.

If you are only building a single binary and want all symbols stripped, you could also
pass `--stripopt=--strip-all` and explicitly build the
`//foo:bar.stripped` version of the target. As described in the section on
`--stripopt`, this applies a strip action after the final binary is
linked rather than including stripping in all of the build's link actions.

#### `--stripopt={{ "<var>" }}strip-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#stripopt}

This is an additional option to pass to the `strip` command when generating
a [`*.stripped` binary](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary_implicit_outputs). The default
is `-S -p`. This option can be used multiple times.

Note: `--stripopt` does not apply to the stripping of the main
binary with `[--strip](#flag--strip)=(always|sometimes)`.

#### `--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}profile-output-dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-instrument}

The `--fdo_instrument` option enables the generation of
FDO (feedback directed optimization) profile output when the
built C/C++ binary is executed. For GCC, the argument provided is used as a
directory prefix for a per-object file directory tree of .gcda files
containing profile information for each .o file.

Once the profile data tree has been generated, the profile tree
should be zipped up, and provided to the
`--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}`
Bazel option to enable the FDO-optimized compilation.

For the LLVM compiler the argument is also the directory under which the raw LLVM profile
data file(s) is dumped. For example:
`--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}/path/to/rawprof/dir/{{ "</var>" }}`.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-optimize}

The `--fdo_optimize` option enables the use of the
per-object file profile information to perform FDO (feedback
directed optimization) optimizations when compiling. For GCC, the argument
provided is the zip file containing the previously-generated file tree
of .gcda files containing profile information for each .o file.

Alternatively, the argument provided can point to an auto profile
identified by the extension .afdo.

Note: This option also accepts labels that resolve to source files. You
may need to add an `exports_files` directive to the corresponding package to
make the file visible to Bazel.

For the LLVM compiler the argument provided should point to the indexed LLVM
profile output file prepared by the llvm-profdata tool, and should have a .profdata
extension.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-language-version}

This option specifies the version of Java sources. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --java_language_version=8 java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

compiles and allows only constructs compatible with Java 8 specification.
Default value is 11. -->
Possible values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 21 and may be extended by
registering custom Java toolchains using `default_java_toolchain`.

#### `--tool_java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-language-version}

The Java language version used to build tools that are executed during a build.
Default value is 11.

#### `--java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-runtime-version}

This option specifies the version of JVM to use to execute the code and run the tests. For
example:

<pre>
  % bazel run --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11 java/com/example/common/foo:java_application
</pre>

downloads JDK 11 from a remote repository and run the Java application using it.

Default value is `local_jdk`.
Possible values are: `local_jdk`, `local_jdk_{{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}`,
`remotejdk_11`, `remotejdk_17`, and `remotejdk_21`.
You can extend the values by registering custom JVM using either
`local_java_repository` or `remote_java_repository` repository rules.

#### `--tool_java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-runtime-version}

The version of JVM used to execute tools that are needed during a build.
Default value is `remotejdk_11`.

#### `--jvmopt={{ "<var>" }}jvm-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#jvmopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to the Java VM. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --jvmopt="-server -Xms256m" java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

will use the server VM for launching all Java binaries and set the
startup heap size for the VM to 256 MB.

#### `--javacopt={{ "<var>" }}javac-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#javacopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to javac. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --javacopt="-g:source,lines" //myprojects:prog
</pre>

will rebuild a java_binary with the javac default debug info
(instead of the bazel default).

The option is passed to javac after the Bazel built-in default options for
javac and before the per-rule options. The last specification of
any option to javac wins. The default options for javac are:

<pre>
  -source 8 -target 8 -encoding UTF-8
</pre>

Note: Changing `--javacopt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected classes. Also note that javacopts parameters listed in
specific java_library or java_binary build rules will be placed on the javac
command line _after_ these options.

#### `--strict_java_deps (default|strict|off|warn|error)` {:#strict-java-deps}

This option controls whether javac checks for missing direct dependencies.
Java targets must explicitly declare all directly used targets as
dependencies. This flag instructs javac to determine the jars actually used
for type checking each java file, and warn/error if they are not the output
of a direct dependency of the current target.

* `off` means checking is disabled.
* `warn` means javac will generate standard java warnings of
  type `[strict]` for each missing direct dependency.
* `default`, `strict` and `error` all
  mean javac will generate errors instead of warnings, causing the current
  target to fail to build if any missing direct dependencies are found.
  This is also the default behavior when the flag is unspecified.

### Build semantics {:#build-semantics}

These options affect the build commands and/or the output file contents.

#### `--compilation_mode (fastbuild|opt|dbg)` (-c) {:#compilation-mode}

The `--compilation_mode` option (often shortened to `-c`,
especially `-c opt`) takes an argument of `fastbuild`, `dbg`
or `opt`, and affects various C/C++ code-generation
options, such as the level of optimization and the completeness of
debug tables. Bazel uses a different output directory for each
different compilation mode, so you can switch between modes without
needing to do a full rebuild _every_ time.

* `fastbuild` means build as fast as possible:
  generate minimal debugging information (`-gmlt
  -Wl,-S`), and don't optimize. This is the
  default. Note: `-DNDEBUG` will **not** be set.
* `dbg` means build with debugging enabled (`-g`),
  so that you can use gdb (or another debugger).
* `opt` means build with optimization enabled and
  with `assert()` calls disabled (`-O2 -DNDEBUG`).
  Debugging information will not be generated in `opt` mode
  unless you also pass `--copt -g`.

#### `--cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cpu}

This option specifies the target CPU architecture to be used for
the compilation of binaries during the build.

Note: A particular combination of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU is allowed only if it has been specified in the currently
used CROSSTOOL file.

#### `--action_env={{ "<var>" }}VAR=VALUE{{ "</var>" }}` {:#action-env}

Specifies the set of environment variables available during the execution of all actions.
Variables can be either specified by name, in which case the value will be taken from the
invocation environment, or by the `name=value` pair which sets the value independent of the
invocation environment.

This `--action_env` flag can be specified multiple times. If a value is assigned to the same
variable across multiple `--action_env` flags, the latest assignment wins.

#### `--experimental_action_listener={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-action-listener}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects)
instead.

The `experimental_action_listener` option instructs Bazel to use
details from the [`action_listener`](/reference/be/extra-actions#action_listener) rule specified by {{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }} to
insert [`extra_actions`](/reference/be/extra-actions#extra_action) into the build graph.

#### `--[no]experimental_extra_action_top_level_only` {:experimental-extra-action-top-level-only}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

If this option is set to true, extra actions specified by the
[ `--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) command
line option will only be scheduled for top level targets.

#### `--experimental_extra_action_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-extra-action-filter}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

The `experimental_extra_action_filter` option instructs Bazel to
filter the set of targets to schedule `extra_actions` for.

This flag is only applicable in combination with the
[`--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) flag.

By default all `extra_actions` in the transitive closure of the
requested targets-to-build get scheduled for execution.
`--experimental_extra_action_filter` will restrict scheduling to
`extra_actions` of which the owner's label matches the specified
regular expression.

The following example will limit scheduling of `extra_actions`
to only apply to actions of which the owner's label contains '/bar/':

<pre>% bazel build --experimental_action_listener=//test:al //foo/... \
  --experimental_extra_action_filter=.*/bar/.*
</pre>

#### `--host_cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cpu}

This option specifies the name of the CPU architecture that should be
used to build host tools.

#### `--android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}platform[,platform]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-platforms}

The platforms to build the transitive `deps` of
`android_binary` rules (specifically for native dependencies like C++). For
example, if a `cc_library` appears in the transitive `deps` of an
`android_binary` rule it is be built once for each platform specified with
`--android_platforms` for the `android_binary` rule, and included in the final
output.

There is no default value for this flag: a custom Android platform must be
defined and used.

One `.so` file is created and packaged in the APK for each platform specified
with `--android_platforms`. The `.so` file's name prefixes the name of the
`android_binary` rule with "lib". For example, if the name of the
`android_binary` is "foo", then the file is `libfoo.so`.

#### `--per_file_copt={{ "<var>" }}[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...{{ "</var>" }}` {:#per-file-copt}

When present, any C++ file with a label or an execution path matching one of the inclusion regex
expressions and not matching any of the exclusion expressions will be built
with the given options. The label matching uses the canonical form of the label
(i.e //`package`:`label_name`).

The execution path is the relative path to your workspace directory including the base name
(including extension) of the C++ file. It also includes any platform dependent prefixes.

Note: If only one of the label or the execution path matches the options will be used.

To match the generated files (such as genrule outputs)
Bazel can only use the execution path. In this case the regexp shouldn't start with '//'
since that doesn't match any execution paths. Package names can be used like this:
`--per_file_copt=base/.*\.pb\.cc@-g0`. This will match every
`.pb.cc` file under a directory called `base`.

This option can be used multiple times.

The option is applied regardless of the compilation mode used. For example, it is possible
to compile with `--compilation_mode=opt` and selectively compile some
files with stronger optimization turned on, or with optimization disabled.

**Caveat**: If some files are selectively compiled with debug symbols the symbols
might be stripped during linking. This can be prevented by setting
`--strip=never`.

**Syntax**: `[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...` Where
`regex` stands for a regular expression that can be prefixed with
a `+` to identify include patterns and with `-` to identify
exclude patterns. `option` stands for an arbitrary option that is passed
to the C++ compiler. If an option contains a `,` it has to be quoted like so
`\,`. Options can also contain `@`, since only the first
`@` is used to separate regular expressions from options.

**Example**:
`--per_file_copt=//foo:.*\.cc,-//foo:file\.cc@-O0,-fprofile-arcs`
adds the `-O0` and the `-fprofile-arcs` options to the command
line of the C++ compiler for all `.cc` files in `//foo/` except `file.cc`.

#### `--dynamic_mode={{ "<var>" }}mode{{ "</var>" }}` {:#dynamic-mode}

Determines whether C++ binaries will be linked dynamically, interacting with
the [linkstatic attribute](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) on build rules.

Modes:

* `default`: Allows bazel to choose whether to link dynamically.
  See [linkstatic](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) for more
  information.
* `fully`: Links all targets dynamically. This will speed up
  linking time, and reduce the size of the resulting binaries.
* `off`: Links all targets in
  [mostly static](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) mode.
  If `-static` is set in linkopts, targets will change to fully static.

#### `--fission (yes|no|[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild])` {:#fission}

Enables [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission){: .external},
which writes C++ debug information to dedicated .dwo files instead of .o files, where it would
otherwise go. This substantially reduces the input size to links and can reduce link times.

When set to `[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild]` (example:
`--fission=dbg,fastbuild`), Fission is enabled
only for the specified set of compilation modes. This is useful for bazelrc
settings. When set to `yes`, Fission is enabled
universally. When set to `no`, Fission is disabled
universally. Default is <code class='flag'>no</code>.

#### `--force_ignore_dash_static` {:#force-ignore-dash-static}

If this flag is set, any `-static` options in linkopts of
`cc_*` rules BUILD files are ignored. This is only intended as a
workaround for C++ hardening builds.

#### `--[no]force_pic` {:#force-pic}

If enabled, all C++ compilations produce position-independent code ("-fPIC"),
links prefer PIC pre-built libraries over non-PIC libraries, and links produce
position-independent executables ("-pie"). Default is disabled.

Note: Dynamically linked binaries (for example `--dynamic_mode fully`)
generate PIC code regardless of this flag's setting. So this flag is for cases
where users want PIC code explicitly generated for static links.

#### `--android_resource_shrinking` {:#flag--android_resource_shrinking}

Selects whether to perform resource shrinking for android_binary rules. Sets the default for the
[shrink_resources attribute](/reference/be/android#android_binary.shrink_resources) on
android_binary rules; see the documentation for that rule for further details. Defaults to off.

#### `--custom_malloc={{ "<var>" }}malloc-library-target{{ "</var>" }}` {:#custom-malloc}

When specified, always use the given malloc implementation, overriding all
`malloc="target"` attributes, including in those targets that use the
default (by not specifying any `malloc`).

#### `--crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#crosstool-top}

This option specifies the location of the crosstool compiler suite
to be used for all C++ compilation during a build. Bazel will look in that
location for a CROSSTOOL file and uses that to automatically determine
settings for `--compiler`.

#### `--host_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-crosstool-top}

If not specified, Bazel uses the value of `--crosstool_top` to compile
code in the exec configuration, such as tools run during the build. The main purpose of this flag
is to enable cross-compilation.

#### `--apple_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#apple-crosstool-top}

The crosstool to use for compiling C/C++ rules in the transitive `deps` of
objc_*, ios__*, and apple_* rules. For those targets, this flag overwrites
`--crosstool_top`.

#### `--compiler={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#compiler}

This option specifies the C/C++ compiler version (such as `gcc-4.1.0`)
to be used for the compilation of binaries during the build. If you want to
build with a custom crosstool, you should use a CROSSTOOL file instead of
specifying this flag.

Note: Only certain combinations of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU are allowed.

#### `--android_sdk={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-sdk}

Deprecated. This shouldn't be directly specified.

This option specifies the Android SDK/platform toolchain
and Android runtime library that will be used to build any Android-related
rule.

The Android SDK will be automatically selected if an `android_sdk_repository`
rule is defined in the WORKSPACE file.

#### `--java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--javabase=({{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }})` {:#javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_javabase={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

### Execution strategy {:#execution-strategy}

These options affect how Bazel will execute the build.
They should not have any significant effect on the output files
generated by the build. Typically their main effect is on the
speed of the build.

#### `--spawn_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#spawn-strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed.

* `standalone` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is
  deprecated. Please use `local` instead.
* `sandboxed` causes commands to be executed inside a sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that all input files, data dependencies and tools are listed as direct
  dependencies in the `srcs`, `data` and `tools` attributes.
  Bazel enables local sandboxing by default, on systems that support sandboxed execution.
* `local` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses.
* `worker` causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.
* `docker` causes commands to be executed inside a docker sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that docker is installed.
* `remote` causes commands to be executed remotely; this is only available if a
  remote executor has been configured separately.

#### `--strategy {{ "<var>" }}mnemonic{{ "</var>" }}={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed, overriding the
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) (and
[--genrule_strategy](#genrule-strategy) with mnemonic
Genrule) on a per-mnemonic basis. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

#### `--strategy_regexp={{ "<var>" }}<filter,filter,...>=<strategy>{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy-regexp}

This option specifies which strategy should be used to execute commands that have descriptions
matching a certain `regex_filter`. See
[--per_file_copt](#per-file-copt) for details on
regex_filter matching. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

The last `regex_filter` that matches the description is used. This option overrides
other flags for specifying strategy.

* Example: `--strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local` means to run actions using
  `local` strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
* Example:
  `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local' --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed`
  runs 'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `sandboxed` strategy, but reversing
  the order runs it with `local`.
* Example: `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local,sandboxed'` runs
  'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `local` strategy and falls back to
  `sandboxed` if it fails.

#### `--genrule_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#genrule-strategy}

This is a deprecated short-hand for `--strategy=Genrule={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}`.

#### `--jobs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` (-j) {:#jobs}

This option, which takes an integer argument, specifies a limit on
the number of jobs that should be executed concurrently during the
execution phase of the build.

Note : The number of concurrent jobs that Bazel will run
is determined not only by the `--jobs` setting, but also
by Bazel's scheduler, which tries to avoid running concurrent jobs
that will use up more resources (RAM or CPU) than are available,
based on some (very crude) estimates of the resource consumption
of each job. The behavior of the scheduler can be controlled by
the `--local_ram_resources` option.

#### `--progress_report_interval={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:progress-report-interval}

Bazel periodically prints a progress report on jobs that are not
finished yet (such as long running tests). This option sets the
reporting frequency, progress will be printed every `n`
seconds.

The default is 0, that means an incremental algorithm: the first
report will be printed after 10 seconds, then 30 seconds and after
that progress is reported once every minute.

When bazel is using cursor control, as specified by
[`--curses`](#curses), progress is reported every second.

#### `--local_{ram,cpu}_resources {{ "<var>" }}resources or resource expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#local-resources}

These options specify the amount of local resources (RAM in MB and number of CPU logical cores)
that Bazel can take into consideration when scheduling build and test activities to run locally. They take
an integer, or a keyword (HOST_RAM or HOST_CPUS) optionally followed by `[-|*`float`]`
(for example, `--local_cpu_resources=2`, `--local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*.5`,
`--local_cpu_resources=HOST_CPUS-1`).
The flags are independent; one or both may be set. By default, Bazel estimates
the amount of RAM and number of CPU cores directly from the local system's configuration.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_links` {:#build-runfile-links}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether the runfiles
symlinks for tests and binaries should be built in the output directory.
Using `--nobuild_runfile_links` can be useful
to validate if all targets compile without incurring the overhead
for building the runfiles trees.

When tests (or applications) are executed, their run-time data
dependencies are gathered together in one place. Within Bazel's
output tree, this "runfiles" tree is typically rooted as a sibling of
the corresponding binary or test.
During test execution, runfiles may be accessed using paths of the form
`$TEST_SRCDIR/{{ "<var>" }}canonical_repo_name{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}packagename{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}filename{{ "</var>" }}`.
The runfiles tree ensures that tests have access to all the files
upon which they have a declared dependence, and nothing more. By
default, the runfiles tree is implemented by constructing a set of
symbolic links to the required files. As the set of links grows, so
does the cost of this operation, and for some large builds it can
contribute significantly to overall build time, particularly because
each individual test (or application) requires its own runfiles tree.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_manifests` {:#build-runfile-manifests}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether runfiles manifests
should be written to the output tree.
Disabling it implies `--nobuild_runfile_links`.

It can be disabled when executing tests remotely, as runfiles trees will
be created remotely from in-memory manifests.

#### `--[no]discard_analysis_cache` {:#discard-analysis-cache}

When this option is enabled, Bazel will discard the analysis cache
right before execution starts, thus freeing up additional memory
(around 10%) for the [execution phase](/run/build#execution).
The drawback is that further incremental builds will be slower. See also
[memory-saving mode](/configure/memory).

#### `--[no]keep_going`  (-k) {:#keep-going}

As in GNU Make, the execution phase of a build stops when the first
error is encountered. Sometimes it is useful to try to build as
much as possible even in the face of errors. This option enables
that behavior, and when it is specified, the build will attempt to
build every target whose prerequisites were successfully built, but
will ignore errors.

While this option is usually associated with the execution phase of
a build, it also affects the analysis phase: if several targets are
specified in a build command, but only some of them can be
successfully analyzed, the build will stop with an error
unless `--keep_going` is specified, in which case the
build will proceed to the execution phase, but only for the targets
that were successfully analyzed.

#### `--[no]use_ijars` {:#use-ijars}

This option changes the way `java_library` targets are
compiled by Bazel. Instead of using the output of a
`java_library` for compiling dependent
`java_library` targets, Bazel will create interface jars
that contain only the signatures of non-private members (public,
protected, and default (package) access methods and fields) and use
the interface jars to compile the dependent targets. This makes it
possible to avoid recompilation when changes are only made to
method bodies or private members of a class.

Note: Using `--use_ijars` might give you a different
error message when you are accidentally referring to a non visible
member of another class: Instead of getting an error that the member
is not visible you will get an error that the member does not exist.
Changing the `--use_ijars` setting will force a recompilation of all affected
classes.

#### `--[no]interface_shared_objects` {:#interface-shared-objects}

This option enables _interface shared objects_, which makes binaries and
other shared libraries depend on the _interface_ of a shared object,
rather than its implementation. When only the implementation changes, Bazel
can avoid rebuilding targets that depend on the changed shared library
unnecessarily.

### Output selection {:#output-selection}

These options determine what to build or test.

#### `--[no]build` {:#build}

This option causes the execution phase of the build to occur; it is
on by default. When it is switched off, the execution phase is
skipped, and only the first two phases, loading and analysis, occur.

This option can be useful for validating BUILD files and detecting
errors in the inputs, without actually building anything.

#### `--[no]build_tests_only` {:#build-tests-only}

If specified, Bazel will build only what is necessary to run the `*_test`
and `test_suite` rules that were not filtered due to their
[size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters).
If specified, Bazel will ignore other targets specified on the command line.
By default, this option is disabled and Bazel will build everything
requested, including `*_test` and `test_suite` rules that are filtered out from
testing. This is useful because running
`bazel test --build_tests_only foo/...` may not detect all build
breakages in the `foo` tree.

#### `--[no]check_up_to_date` {:#check-up-to-date}

This option causes Bazel not to perform a build, but merely check
whether all specified targets are up-to-date. If so, the build
completes successfully, as usual. However, if any files are out of
date, instead of being built, an error is reported and the build
fails. This option may be useful to determine whether a build has
been performed more recently than a source edit (for example, for pre-submit
checks) without incurring the cost of a build.

See also [`--check_tests_up_to_date`](#check-tests-up-to-date).

#### `--[no]compile_one_dependency` {:#compile-one-dependency}

Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This is useful for
syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding a single
target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all
non-flag arguments are interpreted: each argument must be a
file target label or a plain filename relative to the current working
directory, and one rule that depends on each source filename is built. For
C++ and Java
sources, rules in the same language space are preferentially chosen. For
multiple rules with the same preference, the one that appears first in the
BUILD file is chosen. An explicitly named target pattern which does not
reference a source file results in an error.

#### `--save_temps` {:#save-temps}

The `--save_temps` option causes temporary outputs from the compiler to be
saved. These include .s files (assembler code), .i (preprocessed C) and .ii
(preprocessed C++) files. These outputs are often useful for debugging. Temps will only be
generated for the set of targets specified on the command line.

Note: The implementation of `--save_temps` does not use the compiler's
`-save-temps` flag. Instead, there are two passes, one with `-S`
and one with `-E`. A consequence of this is that if your build fails,
Bazel may not yet have produced the ".i" or ".ii" and ".s" files.
If you're trying to use `--save_temps` to debug a failed compilation,
you may need to also use `--keep_going` so that Bazel will still try to
produce the preprocessed files after the compilation fails.

The `--save_temps` flag currently works only for cc_* rules.

To ensure that Bazel prints the location of the additional output files, check that
your [`--show_result {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}`](#show-result)
setting is high enough.

#### `--build_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#build-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will build only targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Build tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

When running tests, Bazel ignores `--build_tag_filters` for test targets,
which are built and run even if they do not match this filter. To avoid building them, filter
test targets using `--test_tag_filters` or by explicitly excluding them.

#### `--test_size_filters={{ "<var>" }}size[,size]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-size-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given size. Test size filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test size values (small,
medium, large or enormous), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test sizes. For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=small,medium //foo:all
</pre>

and

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=-large,-enormous //foo:all
</pre>

will test only small and medium tests inside //foo.

By default, test size filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_timeout_filters={{ "<var>" }}timeout[,timeout]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given timeout. Test timeout filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test timeout values (short,
moderate, long or eternal), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test timeouts. See [--test_size_filters](#test-size-filters)
for example syntax.

By default, test timeout filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Test tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_tag_filters=performance,stress,-flaky //myproject:all
</pre>

will test targets that are tagged with either `performance` or
`stress` tag but are **not** tagged with the `flaky` tag.

By default, test tag filtering is not applied. Note that you can also filter
on test's `size` and `local` tags in
this manner.

#### `--test_lang_filters={{ "<var>" }}string[,string]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-lang-filters}

Specifies a comma-separated list of strings referring to names of test rule
classes. To refer to the rule class `foo_test`, use the string "foo". Bazel will
test (or build if `--build_tests_only` is also specified) only
targets of the referenced rule classes. To instead exclude those targets, use
the string "-foo". For example,

</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=foo,bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test only targets that are instances of `foo_test` or `bar_test` in
  `//baz/...`, while
</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=-foo,-bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test all the targets in `//baz/...` except for the `foo_test` and
  `bar_test` instances.
</p>

Tip: You can use `bazel query --output=label_kind "//p:t"` to
learn the rule class name of the target `//p:t`. And you can
look at the pair of instantiation stacks in the output of
`bazel query --output=build "//p:t"` to learn why that target
is an instance of that rule class.

Warning: The option name "--test_lang_filter" is vestigal and is therefore
unfortunately misleading; don't make assumptions about the semantics based on
the name.

#### `--test_filter={{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-filter}

Specifies a filter that the test runner may use to pick a subset of tests for
running. All targets specified in the invocation are built, but depending on
the expression only some of them may be executed; in some cases, only certain
test methods are run.

The particular interpretation of {{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }} is up to
the test framework responsible for running the test. It may be a glob,
substring, or regexp. `--test_filter` is a convenience
over passing different `--test_arg` filter arguments,
but not all frameworks support it.

### Verbosity {:#verbosity}

These options control the verbosity of Bazel's output,
either to the terminal, or to additional log files.

#### `--explain={{ "<var>" }}logfile{{ "</var>" }}` {:#explain}

This option, which requires a filename argument, causes the
dependency checker in `bazel build`'s execution phase to
explain, for each build step, either why it is being executed, or
that it is up-to-date. The explanation is written
to _logfile_.

If you are encountering unexpected rebuilds, this option can help to
understand the reason. Add it to your `.bazelrc` so that
logging occurs for all subsequent builds, and then inspect the log
when you see an execution step executed unexpectedly. This option
may carry a small performance penalty, so you might want to remove
it when it is no longer needed.

#### `--verbose_explanations` {:#verbose-explanations}

This option increases the verbosity of the explanations generated
when the [--explain](#explain) option is enabled.

In particular, if verbose explanations are enabled,
and an output file is rebuilt because the command used to
build it has changed, then the output in the explanation file will
include the full details of the new command (at least for most
commands).

Using this option may significantly increase the length of the
generated explanation file and the performance penalty of using
`--explain`.

If `--explain` is not enabled, then
`--verbose_explanations` has no effect.

#### `--profile={{ "<var>" }}file{{ "</var>" }}` {:#profile}

This option, which takes a filename argument, causes Bazel to write
profiling data into a file. The data then can be analyzed or parsed using the
`bazel analyze-profile` command. The Build profile can be useful in
understanding where Bazel's `build` command is spending its time.

#### `--[no]show_loading_progress` {:#show-loading-progress}

This option causes Bazel to output package-loading progress
messages. If it is disabled, the messages won't be shown.

#### `--[no]show_progress` {:#show-progress}

This option causes progress messages to be displayed; it is on by
default. When disabled, progress messages are suppressed.

#### `--show_progress_rate_limit={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-progress-rate}

This option causes bazel to display at most one progress message per `n` seconds,
where {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }} is a real number.
The default value for this option is 0.02, meaning bazel will limit the progress
messages to one per every 0.02 seconds.

#### `--show_result={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-result}

This option controls the printing of result information at the end
of a `bazel build` command. By default, if a single
build target was specified, Bazel prints a message stating whether
or not the target was successfully brought up-to-date, and if so,
the list of output files that the target created. If multiple
targets were specified, result information is not displayed.

While the result information may be useful for builds of a single
target or a few targets, for large builds (such as an entire top-level
project tree), this information can be overwhelming and distracting;
this option allows it to be controlled. `--show_result`
takes an integer argument, which is the maximum number of targets
for which full result information should be printed. By default,
the value is 1. Above this threshold, no result information is
shown for individual targets. Thus zero causes the result
information to be suppressed always, and a very large value causes
the result to be printed always.

Users may wish to choose a value in-between if they regularly
alternate between building a small group of targets (for example,
during the compile-edit-test cycle) and a large group of targets
(for example, when establishing a new workspace or running
regression tests). In the former case, the result information is
very useful whereas in the latter case it is less so. As with all
options, this can be specified implicitly via
the [`.bazelrc`](/run/bazelrc) file.

The files are printed so as to make it easy to copy and paste the
filename to the shell, to run built executables. The "up-to-date"
or "failed" messages for each target can be easily parsed by scripts
which drive a build.

#### `--sandbox_debug` {:#sandbox-debug}

This option causes Bazel to print extra debugging information when using sandboxing for action
execution. This option also preserves sandbox directories, so that the files visible to actions
during execution can be examined.

#### `--subcommands` (`-s`) {:#subcommands}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for each command prior to executing it.

<pre>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # //examples/cpp:hello-world [action 'Linking examples/cpp/hello-world']
  (cd /home/johndoe/.cache/bazel/_bazel_johndoe/4c084335afceb392cfbe7c31afee3a9f/bazel && \
    exec env - \
    /usr/bin/gcc -o bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world -B/usr/bin/ -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now -no-canonical-prefixes -pass-exit-codes -Wl,-S -Wl,@bazel-out/local_linux-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world-2.params)
</pre>

Where possible, commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax,
so that they can be easily copied and pasted to a shell command prompt.
(The surrounding parentheses are provided to protect your shell from the
`cd` and `exec` calls; be sure to copy them!)
However some commands are implemented internally within Bazel, such as
creating symlink trees. For these there's no command line to display.

`--subcommands=pretty_print` may be passed to print
the arguments of the command as a list rather than as a single line. This may
help make long command lines more readable.

See also [--verbose_failures](#verbose-failures), below.

For logging subcommands to a file in a tool-friendly format, see
[--execution_log_json_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_json_file)
and
[--execution_log_binary_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_binary_file).

#### `--verbose_failures` {:#verbose-failures}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for commands that failed. This can be invaluable for debugging a
failing build.

Failing commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax, suitable
for copying and pasting to a shell prompt.

### Workspace status {:#workspace-status}

Use these options to "stamp" Bazel-built binaries: to embed additional information into the
binaries, such as the source control revision or other workspace-related information. You can use
this mechanism with rules that support the `stamp` attribute, such as
`genrule`, `cc_binary`, and more.

#### `--workspace_status_command={{ "<var>" }}program{{ "</var>" }}` {:#workspace-status-command}

This flag lets you specify a binary that Bazel runs before each build. The program can report
information about the status of the workspace, such as the current source control revision.

The flag's value must be a path to a native program. On Linux/macOS this may be any executable.
On Windows this must be a native binary, typically an ".exe", ".bat", or a ".cmd" file.

The program should print zero or more key/value pairs to standard output, one entry on each line,
then exit with zero (otherwise the build fails). The key names can be anything but they may only
use upper case letters and underscores. The first space after the key name separates it from the
value. The value is the rest of the line (including additional whitespaces). Neither the key nor
the value may span multiple lines. Keys must not be duplicated.

Bazel partitions the keys into two buckets: "stable" and "volatile". (The names "stable" and
"volatile" are a bit counter-intuitive, so don't think much about them.)

Bazel then writes the key-value pairs into two files:

*   `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
    contains all keys and values where the key's name starts with `STABLE_`
*   `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
    contains the rest of the keys and their values

The contract is:

*   "stable" keys' values should change rarely, if possible. If the contents of
    `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
      change, Bazel invalidates the actions that depend on them. In
      other words, if a stable key's value changes, Bazel will rerun stamped actions.
      Therefore the stable status should not contain things like timestamps, because they change all
      the time, and would make Bazel rerun stamped actions with each build.

    Bazel always outputs the following stable keys:
    *   `BUILD_EMBED_LABEL`: value of `--embed_label`
    *   `BUILD_HOST`: the name of the host machine that Bazel is running on
    *   `BUILD_USER`: the name of the user that Bazel is running as
*   "volatile" keys' values may change often. Bazel expects them to change all the time, like
      timestamps do, and duly updates the
    `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
      file. In order to avoid
      rerunning stamped actions all the time though, **Bazel pretends that the volatile file never
      changes**. In other words, if the volatile status file is the only file whose contents has
      changed, Bazel will not invalidate actions that depend on it. If other inputs of the actions
      have changed, then Bazel reruns that action, and the action will see the updated volatile
      status, but just the volatile status changing alone will not invalidate the action.

    Bazel always outputs the following volatile keys:
      *   `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: time of the build in seconds since the Unix Epoch (the value
        of `System.currentTimeMillis()` divided by a thousand)
      *   `FORMATTED_DATE`: time of the build Formatted as
        `yyyy MMM d HH mm ss EEE`(for example 2023 Jun 2 01 44 29 Fri) in UTC.

On Linux/macOS you can pass `--workspace_status_command=/bin/true` to
disable retrieving workspace status, because `true` does nothing, successfully (exits
with zero) and prints no output. On Windows you can pass the path of MSYS's `true.exe`
for the same effect.

If the workspace status command fails (exits non-zero) for any reason, the build will fail.

Example program on Linux using Git:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo "CURRENT_TIME $(date +%s)"
echo "RANDOM_HASH $(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
echo "STABLE_GIT_COMMIT $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
echo "STABLE_USER_NAME $USER"
</pre>

Pass this program's path with `--workspace_status_command`, and the stable status file
will include the STABLE lines and the volatile status file will include the rest of the lines.

#### `--[no]stamp` {:#stamp}

This option, in conjunction with the `stamp` rule attribute, controls whether to
embed build information in binaries.

Stamping can be enabled or disabled explicitly on a per-rule basis using the
`stamp` attribute. Please refer to the Build Encyclopedia for details. When
a rule sets `stamp = -1` (the default for `*_binary` rules), this option
determines whether stamping is enabled.

Bazel never stamps binaries that are built for the exec configuration,
regardless of this option or the `stamp` attribute. For rules that set `stamp =
0` (the default for `*_test` rules), stamping is disabled regardless of
`--[no]stamp`. Specifying `--stamp` does not force targets to be rebuilt if
their dependencies have not changed.

Setting `--nostamp` is generally desireable for build performance, as it
reduces input volatility and maximizes build caching.

### Platform {:#platform}

Use these options to control the host and target platforms that configure how builds work, and to
control what execution platforms and toolchains are available to Bazel rules.

Please see background information on [Platforms](/extending/platforms) and [Toolchains](/extending/toolchains).

#### `--platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platforms}

The labels of the platform rules describing the target platforms for the
current command.

#### `--host_platform={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-platform}

The label of a platform rule that describes the host system.

#### `--extra_execution_platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-execution-platforms}

The platforms that are available as execution platforms to run actions.
Platforms can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These
platforms will be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_execution_platforms()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_execution_platforms).
This option accepts a comma-separated list of platforms in order of priority.
If the flag is passed multiple times, the most recent overrides.

#### `--extra_toolchains={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-toolchains}

The toolchain rules to be considered during toolchain resolution. Toolchains
can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These toolchains will
be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_toolchains()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_toolchains).

#### `--toolchain_resolution_debug={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#toolchain-resolution-debug}

Print debug information while finding toolchains if the toolchain type matches
the regex. Multiple regexes can be separated by commas. The regex can be
negated by using a `-` at the beginning. This might help developers
of Bazel or Starlark rules with debugging failures due to missing toolchains.

### Miscellaneous {:#miscellaneous}

#### `--flag_alias={{ "<var>" }}alias_name=target_path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flag-alias}

A convenience flag used to bind longer Starlark build settings to a shorter name. For more
details, see the
[Starlark Configurations](/extending/config#using-build-setting-aliases).

#### `--symlink_prefix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#symlink-prefix}

Changes the prefix of the generated convenience symlinks. The
default value for the symlink prefix is `bazel-` which
will create the symlinks `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`, and
`bazel-genfiles`.

If the symbolic links cannot be created for any reason, a warning is
issued but the build is still considered a success. In particular,
this allows you to build in a read-only directory or one that you have no
permission to write into. Any paths printed in informational
messages at the conclusion of a build will only use the
symlink-relative short form if the symlinks point to the expected
location; in other words, you can rely on the correctness of those
paths, even if you cannot rely on the symlinks being created.

Some common values of this option:

*   **Suppress symlink creation:**
      `--symlink_prefix=/` will cause Bazel to not
      create or update any symlinks, including the `bazel-out` and
      `bazel-<workspace>`
      symlinks. Use this option to suppress symlink creation entirely.

*   **Reduce clutter:**
      `--symlink_prefix=.bazel/` will cause Bazel to create
      symlinks called `bin` (etc) inside a hidden directory `.bazel`.

#### `--platform_suffix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platform-suffix}

Adds a suffix to the configuration short name, which is used to determine the
output directory. Setting this option to different values puts the files into
different directories, for example to improve cache hit rates for builds that
otherwise clobber each others output files, or to keep the output files around
for comparisons.

#### `--default_visibility={{ "<var>" }}(private|public){{ "</var>" }}` {:#default-visibility}

Temporary flag for testing bazel default visibility changes. Not intended for general use
but documented for completeness' sake.

#### `--starlark_cpu_profile=_file_` {:#starlark-cpu-profile}

This flag, whose value is the name of a file, causes Bazel to gather
statistics about CPU usage by all Starlark threads,
and write the profile, in [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof){: .external} format,
to the named file.

Use this option to help identify Starlark functions that
make loading and analysis slow due to excessive computation. For example:

<pre>
$ bazel build --nobuild --starlark_cpu_profile=/tmp/pprof.gz my/project/...
$ pprof /tmp/pprof.gz

For different views of the same data, try the `pprof` commands `svg`,
`web`, and `list`.

## Using Bazel for releases {:#bazel-for-releases}

Bazel is used both by software engineers during the development
cycle, and by release engineers when preparing binaries for deployment
to production. This section provides a list of tips for release
engineers using Bazel.

### Significant options {:#significant-options}

When using Bazel for release builds, the same issues arise as for other scripts
that perform a build. For more details, see
[Call Bazel from scripts](/run/scripts). In particular, the following options
are strongly recommended:

*   [`--bazelrc=/dev/null`](/run/bazelrc)
*   [`--nokeep_state_after_build`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--keep_state_after_build)

These options are also important:

*   [`--package_path`](#package-path)
*   [`--symlink_prefix`](#symlink-prefix):
    for managing builds for multiple configurations,
    it may be convenient to distinguish each build
    with a distinct identifier, such as "64bit" vs. "32bit". This option
    differentiates the `bazel-bin` (etc.) symlinks.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To build and run tests with bazel, type `bazel test` followed by
the name of the test targets.

By default, this command performs simultaneous build and test
activity, building all specified targets (including any non-test
targets specified on the command line) and testing
`*_test` and `test_suite` targets as soon as
their prerequisites are built, meaning that test execution is
interleaved with building. Doing so usually results in significant
speed gains.

### Options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-options}

#### `--cache_test_results=(yes|no|auto)` (`-t`) {:#cache-test-results}

If this option is set to 'auto' (the default) then Bazel will only rerun a test if any of the
following conditions applies:

*   Bazel detects changes in the test or its dependencies
*   the test is marked as `external`
*   multiple test runs were requested with `--runs_per_test`
*   the test failed.

If 'no', all tests will be executed unconditionally.

If 'yes', the caching behavior will be the same as auto
except that it may cache test failures and test runs with
`--runs_per_test`.

Note: Test results are _always_ saved in Bazel's output tree,
regardless of whether this option is enabled, so
you needn't have used `--cache_test_results` on the
prior run(s) of `bazel test` in order to get cache hits.
The option only affects whether Bazel will _use_ previously
saved results, not whether it will save results of the current run.

Users who have enabled this option by default in
their `.bazelrc` file may find the
abbreviations `-t` (on) or `-t-` (off)
convenient for overriding the default on a particular run.

#### `--check_tests_up_to_date` {:#check-tests-up-to-date}

This option tells Bazel not to run the tests, but to merely check and report
the cached test results. If there are any tests which have not been
previously built and run, or whose tests results are out-of-date (for example, because
the source code or the build options have changed), then Bazel will report
an error message ("test result is not up-to-date"), will record the test's
status as "NO STATUS" (in red, if color output is enabled), and will return
a non-zero exit code.

This option also implies
[`--check_up_to_date`](#check-up-to-date) behavior.

This option may be useful for pre-submit checks.

#### `--test_verbose_timeout_warnings` {:#test-verbose-timeout-warnings}

This option tells Bazel to explicitly warn the user if a test's timeout is
significantly longer than the test's actual execution time. While a test's
timeout should be set such that it is not flaky, a test that has a highly
over-generous timeout can hide real problems that crop up unexpectedly.

For instance, a test that normally executes in a minute or two should not have
a timeout of ETERNAL or LONG as these are much, much too generous.

This option is useful to help users decide on a good timeout value or
sanity check existing timeout values.

Note: Each test shard is allotted the timeout of the entire
`XX_test` target. Using this option does not affect a test's timeout
value, merely warns if Bazel thinks the timeout could be restricted further.

#### `--[no]test_keep_going` {:#test-keep-going}

By default, all tests are run to completion. If this flag is disabled,
however, the build is aborted on any non-passing test. Subsequent build steps
and test invocations are not run, and in-flight invocations are canceled.
Do not specify both `--notest_keep_going` and `--keep_going`.

#### `--flaky_test_attempts={{ "<var>" }}attempts{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flaky-test-attempts}

This option specifies the maximum number of times a test should be attempted
if it fails for any reason. A test that initially fails but eventually
succeeds is reported as `FLAKY` on the test summary. It is,
however, considered to be passed when it comes to identifying Bazel exit code
or total number of passed tests. Tests that fail all allowed attempts are
considered to be failed.

By default (when this option is not specified, or when it is set to
default), only a single attempt is allowed for regular tests, and
3 for test rules with the `flaky` attribute set. You can specify
an integer value to override the maximum limit of test attempts. Bazel allows
a maximum of 10 test attempts in order to prevent abuse of the system.

#### `--runs_per_test={{ "<var>" }}[regex@]number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#runs-per-test}

This option specifies the number of times each test should be executed. All
test executions are treated as separate tests (fallback functionality
will apply to each of them independently).

The status of a target with failing runs depends on the value of the
`--runs_per_test_detects_flakes` flag:

*  If absent, any failing run causes the entire test to fail.
*  If present and two runs from the same shard return PASS and FAIL, the test
   will receive a status of flaky (unless other failing runs cause it to
   fail).

If a single number is specified, all tests will run that many times.
Alternatively, a regular expression may be specified using the syntax
regex@number. This constrains the effect of `--runs_per_test` to targets
which match the regex (`--runs_per_test=^//pizza:.*@4` runs all tests
under `//pizza/` 4 times).
This form of `--runs_per_test` may be specified more than once.

#### `--[no]runs_per_test_detects_flakes` {:#run-per-test-detects-flakes}

If this option is specified (by default it is not), Bazel will detect flaky
test shards through `--runs_per_test`. If one or more runs for a single shard
fail and one or more runs for the same shard pass, the target will be
considered flaky with the flag. If unspecified, the target will report a
failing status.

#### `--test_summary={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-summary}

Specifies how the test result summary should be displayed.

*   `short` prints the results of each test along with the name of
    the file containing the test output if the test failed. This is the default
    value.
*   `terse` like `short`, but even shorter: only print
    information about tests which did not pass.
*   `detailed` prints each individual test case that failed, not
    only each test. The names of test output files are omitted.
*   `none` does not print test summary.

#### `--test_output={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-output}

Specifies how test output should be displayed:

*   `summary` shows a summary of whether each test passed or
    failed. Also shows the output log file name for failed tests. The summary
    will be printed at the end of the build (during the build, one would see
    just simple progress messages when tests start, pass or fail).
    This is the default behavior.
*   `errors` sends combined stdout/stderr output from failed tests
    only into the stdout immediately after test is completed, ensuring that
    test output from simultaneous tests is not interleaved with each other.
    Prints a summary at the build as per summary output above.
*   `all` is similar to `errors` but prints output for
    all tests, including those which passed.
*   `streamed` streams stdout/stderr output from each test in
    real-time.

#### `--java_debug` {:#java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine of a java test to wait for a connection from a
JDWP-compliant debugger before starting the test. This option implies `--test_output=streamed`.

#### `--[no]verbose_test_summary` {:#verbose-test-summary}

By default this option is enabled, causing test times and other additional
information (such as test attempts) to be printed to the test summary. If
`--noverbose_test_summary` is specified, test summary will
include only test name, test status and cached test indicator and will
be formatted to stay within 80 characters when possible.

#### `--test_tmpdir={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tmpdir}

Specifies temporary directory for tests executed locally. Each test will be
executed in a separate subdirectory inside this directory. The directory will
be cleaned at the beginning of the each `bazel test` command.
By default, bazel will place this directory under Bazel output base directory.

Note: This is a directory for running tests, not storing test results
(those are always stored under the `bazel-out` directory).

#### `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` OR `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout}

Overrides the timeout value for all tests by using specified number of
seconds as a new timeout value. If only one value is provided, then it will
be used for all test timeout categories.

Alternatively, four comma-separated values may be provided, specifying
individual timeouts for short, moderate, long and eternal tests (in that
order).
In either form, zero or a negative value for any of the test sizes will
be substituted by the default timeout for the given timeout categories as
defined by the page [Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia).
By default, Bazel will use these timeouts for all tests by
inferring the timeout limit from the test's size whether the size is
implicitly or explicitly set.

Tests which explicitly state their timeout category as distinct from their
size will receive the same value as if that timeout had been implicitly set by
the size tag. So a test of size 'small' which declares a 'long' timeout will
have the same effective timeout that a 'large' tests has with no explicit
timeout.

#### `--test_arg={{ "<var>" }}arg{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-arg}

Passes command-line options/flags/arguments to each test process. This
option can be used multiple times to pass several arguments. For example,
`--test_arg=--logtostderr --test_arg=--v=3`.

Note that, unlike the `bazel run` command, you can't pass test arguments
directly as in `bazel test -- target --logtostderr --v=3`. That's because
extraneous arguments passed to `bazel test` are interpreted as additional test
targets. That is, `--logtostderr` and `--v=3` would each be interpreted as a
test target. This ambiguity doesn't exist for a `bazel run` command, which only
accepts one target.

`--test_arg` can be passed to a `bazel run` command, but it's ignored unless the
target being run is a test target. (As with any other flag, if it's passed in a
`bazel run` command after a `--` token, it's not processed by Bazel but
forwarded verbatim to the executed target.)

#### `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}=_value_` OR `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-env}

Specifies additional variables that must be injected into the test
environment for each test. If {{ "<var>" }}value{{ "</var>" }} is not specified it will be
inherited from the shell environment used to start the `bazel test`
command.

The environment can be accessed from within a test by using
`System.getenv("var")` (Java), `getenv("var")` (C or C++),

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-run-under}

This specifies a prefix that the test runner will insert in front
of the test command before running it. The
{{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }} is split into words using Bourne shell
tokenization rules, and then the list of words is prepended to the
command that will be executed.

If the first word is a fully-qualified label (starts with
`//`) it is built. Then the label is substituted by the
corresponding executable location that is prepended to the command
that will be executed along with the other words.

Some caveats apply:

*   The PATH used for running tests may be different than the PATH in your environment,
    so you may need to use an **absolute path** for the `--run_under`
    command (the first word in {{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}).
*   **`stdin` is not connected**, so `--run_under`
    can't be used for interactive commands.

Examples:

<pre>
        --run_under=/usr/bin/strace
        --run_under='/usr/bin/strace -c'
        --run_under=/usr/bin/valgrind
        --run_under='/usr/bin/valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20'
</pre>

#### Test selection {:#test-selection}

As documented under [Output selection options](#output-selection),
you can filter tests by [size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters). A convenience
[general name filter](#test-filter) can forward particular
filter args to the test runner.

#### Other options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-other-options}

The syntax and the remaining options are exactly like
[`bazel build`](/run/build).

## Running executables {:#running-executables}

The `bazel run` command is similar to `bazel build`, except
it is used to build _and run_ a single target. Here is a typical session
(`//java/myapp:myapp` says hello and prints out its args):

<pre>
  % bazel run java/myapp:myapp -- --arg1 --arg2
  INFO: Analyzed target //java/myapp:myapp (13 packages loaded, 27 targets configured).
  INFO: Found 1 target...
  Target //java/myapp:myapp up-to-date:
    bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp
  INFO: Elapsed time: 14.290s, Critical Path: 5.54s, ...
  INFO: Build completed successfully, 4 total actions
  INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp &lt;args omitted&gt;
  Hello there
  $EXEC_ROOT/java/myapp/myapp
  --arg1
  --arg2
</pre>

Note: `--` is needed so that Bazel
does not interpret `--arg1` and `--arg2` as
Bazel options, but rather as part of the command line for running the binary.
Additionally, Bazel will avoid logging these arguments to the console in case
they contain sensitive information.

`bazel run` is similar, but not identical, to directly invoking
the binary built by Bazel and its behavior is different depending on whether the
binary to be invoked is a test or not.

When the binary is not a test, the current working directory will be the
runfiles tree of the binary.

When the binary is a test, the current working directory will be the exec root
and a good-faith attempt is made to replicate the environment tests are usually
run in. The emulation is not perfect, though, and tests that have multiple
shards cannot be run this way (the
`--test_sharding_strategy=disabled` command line option can be used
to work around this)

The following extra environment variables are also available to the binary:

*   `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`: the root of the workspace where the
    build was run.
*   `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY`: the current working directory where
    Bazel was run from.
*   `BUILD_ID`: the build ID of the `bazel run` invocation. This is usually
    unique, except if Bazel was run with `--script_path` and the resulting
    script is re-used.
*   `BUILD_EXECROOT`: the execution root of the `bazel run` invocation.

These can be used, for example, to interpret file names on the command line in
a user-friendly way.

### Options for `bazel run` {:#bazel-run-options}

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#run-run-under}

This has the same effect as the `--run_under` option for
`bazel test` ([see above](#test-run-under)),
except that it applies to the command being run by `bazel
run` rather than to the tests being run by `bazel test`
and cannot run under label.

#### Filtering logging outputs from Bazel

When invoking a binary with `bazel run`, Bazel prints logging output from Bazel
itself and the binary under invocation. To make the logs less noisy, you can
suppress the outputs from Bazel itself with the `--ui_event_filters` and
`--noshow_progress` flags.

For example:
`bazel run --ui_event_filters=-info,-stdout,-stderr --noshow_progress //java/myapp:myapp`

### Executing tests {:#executing-tests}

`bazel run` can also execute test binaries, which has the effect of
running the test in a close approximation of the environment described at
[Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia). Note that none of the
`--test_*` arguments have an effect when running a test in this manner except
`--test_arg` .

## Cleaning build outputs {:#cleaning-build-outputs}

### The `clean` command {:#clean}

Bazel has a `clean` command, analogous to that of Make.
It deletes the output directories for all build configurations performed
by this Bazel instance, or the entire working tree created by this
Bazel instance, and resets internal caches. If executed without any
command-line options, then the output directory for all configurations
will be cleaned.

Recall that each Bazel instance is associated with a single workspace, thus the
`clean` command will delete all outputs from all builds you've done
with that Bazel instance in that workspace.

To completely remove the entire working tree created by a Bazel
instance,  you can specify the `--expunge` option. When
executed with `--expunge`, the clean command simply
removes the entire output base tree which, in addition to the build
output, contains all temp files created by Bazel. It also
stops the Bazel server after the clean, equivalent to the [`shutdown`](#shutdown) command. For example, to
clean up all disk and memory traces of a Bazel instance, you could
specify:

<pre>
  % bazel clean --expunge
</pre>

Alternatively, you can expunge in the background by using
`--expunge_async`. It is safe to invoke a Bazel command
in the same client while the asynchronous expunge continues to run.

Note: This may introduce IO contention.

The `clean` command is provided primarily as a means of
reclaiming disk space for workspaces that are no longer needed.
Bazel's incremental rebuilds may not be
perfect so `clean` can be used to recover a consistent
state when problems arise.

Bazel's design is such that these problems are fixable and
these bugs are a high priority to be fixed. If you
ever find an incorrect incremental build, file a bug report, and report bugs in the tools
rather than using `clean`.

## Querying the dependency graph {:#querying-dependency-graph}

Bazel includes a query language for asking questions about the
dependency graph used during the build. The query language is used
by two commands: query and cquery. The major difference between the
two commands is that query runs after the [loading phase](/run/build#loading)
and cquery runs after the [analysis phase](/run/build#analysis). These tools are an
invaluable aid to many software engineering tasks.

The query language is based on the idea of
algebraic operations over graphs; it is documented in detail in

[Bazel Query Reference](/query/language).
Please refer to that document for reference, for
examples, and for query-specific command-line options.

The query tool accepts several command-line
option. `--output` selects the output format.
`--[no]keep_going` (disabled by default) causes the query
tool to continue to make progress upon errors; this behavior may be
disabled if an incomplete result is not acceptable in case of errors.

The `--[no]tool_deps` option,
enabled by default, causes dependencies in non-target configurations to be included in the
dependency graph over which the query operates.

The `--[no]implicit_deps` option, enabled by default, causes
implicit dependencies to be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An
implicit dependency is one that is not explicitly specified in the BUILD file
but added by bazel.

Example: "Show the locations of the definitions (in BUILD files) of
all genrules required to build all the tests in the PEBL tree."

<pre>
  bazel query --output location 'kind(genrule, deps(kind(".*_test rule", foo/bar/pebl/...)))'
</pre>

## Querying the action graph {:#aquery}

Caution: The aquery command is still experimental and its API will change.

The `aquery` command allows you to query for actions in your build graph.
It operates on the post-analysis configured target graph and exposes
information about actions, artifacts and their relationships.

The tool accepts several command-line options.
`--output` selects the output format. The default output format
(`text`) is human-readable, use `proto` or `textproto` for
machine-readable format.
Notably, the aquery command runs on top of a regular Bazel build and inherits
the set of options available during a build.

It supports the same set of functions that is also available to traditional
`query` but `siblings`, `buildfiles` and
`tests`.

For more details, see [Action Graph Query](/query/aquery).

## Miscellaneous commands and options {:#misc-commands-options}

### `help` {:#help}

The `help` command provides on-line help. By default, it
shows a summary of available commands and help topics, as shown in
[Building with Bazel](/run/build#quickstart).
Specifying an argument displays detailed help for a particular
topic. Most topics are Bazel commands, such as `build`
or `query`, but there are some additional help topics
that do not correspond to commands.

#### `--[no]long` (`-l`) {:#long}

By default, `bazel help [{{ "<var>" }}topic{{ "</var>" }}]` prints only a
summary of the relevant options for a topic. If
the `--long` option is specified, the type, default value
and full description of each option is also printed.

### `shutdown` {:#shutdown}

Bazel server processes may be stopped by using the `shutdown`
command. This command causes the Bazel server to exit as soon as it
becomes idle (for example, after the completion of any builds or other
commands that are currently in progress). For more details, see
[Client/server implementation](/run/client-server).

Bazel servers stop themselves after an idle timeout, so this command
is rarely necessary; however, it can be useful in scripts when it is
known that no further builds will occur in a given workspace.

`shutdown` accepts one
option, `--iff_heap_size_greater_than _n_`, which
requires an integer argument (in MB). If specified, this makes the shutdown
conditional on the amount of memory already consumed. This is
useful for scripts that initiate a lot of builds, as any memory
leaks in the Bazel server could cause it to crash spuriously on
occasion; performing a conditional restart preempts this condition.

### `info` {:#info}

The `info` command prints various values associated with
the Bazel server instance, or with a specific build configuration.
(These may be used by scripts that drive a build.)

The `info` command also permits a single (optional)
argument, which is the name of one of the keys in the list below.
In this case, `bazel info {{ "<var>" }}key{{ "</var>" }}` will print only
the value for that one key. (This is especially convenient when
scripting Bazel, as it avoids the need to pipe the result
through `sed -ne /key:/s/key://p`:

#### Configuration-independent data {:#configuration-independent-data}

*   `release`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary.
*   `workspace` the absolute path to the base workspace
    directory.
*   `install_base`: the absolute path to the installation
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user. Bazel
    installs its internally required executables below this directory.

*   `output_base`: the absolute path to the base output
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user and
    workspace combination. Bazel puts all of its scratch and build
    output below this directory.
*   `execution_root`: the absolute path to the execution
    root directory under output_base. This directory is the root for all files
    accessible to commands executed during the build, and is the working
    directory for those commands. If the workspace directory is writable, a
    symlink named `bazel-<workspace>`
    is placed there pointing to this directory.
*   `output_path`: the absolute path to the output
    directory beneath the execution root used for all files actually
    generated as a result of build commands. If the workspace directory is
    writable, a symlink named `bazel-out` is placed there pointing
    to this directory.
*   `server_pid`: the process ID of the Bazel server
     process.
*   `server_log`: the absolute path to the Bazel server's debug log file.
    This file contains debugging information for all commands over the lifetime of the
    Bazel server, and is intended for human consumption by Bazel developers and power users.
*   `command_log`: the absolute path to the command log file;
    this contains the interleaved stdout and stderr streams of the most recent
    Bazel command. Note that running `bazel info` will overwrite the
    contents of this file, since it then becomes the most recent Bazel command.
    However, the location of the command log file will not change unless you
    change the setting of the `--output_base` or
    `--output_user_root` options.
*   `used-heap-size`,
      `committed-heap-size`,
      `max-heap-size`: reports various JVM heap size
    parameters. Respectively: memory currently used, memory currently
    guaranteed to be available to the JVM from the system, maximum
    possible allocation.
*   `gc-count`, `gc-time`: The cumulative count of
    garbage collections since the start of this Bazel server and the time spent
    to perform them. Note that these values are not reset at the start of every
    build.
*   `package_path`: A colon-separated list of paths which would be
    searched for packages by bazel. Has the same format as the
    `--package_path` build command line argument.

Example: the process ID of the Bazel server.

<pre>% bazel info server_pid
1285
</pre>

#### Configuration-specific data {:#configuration-specific-data}

These data may be affected by the configuration options passed
to `bazel info`, for
example `--cpu`, `--compilation_mode`,
etc. The `info` command accepts all
the options that control dependency
analysis, since some of these determine the location of the
output directory of a build, the choice of compiler, etc.

*   `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`,
    `bazel-genfiles`: reports the absolute path to
    the `bazel-*` directories in which programs generated by the
    build are located. This is usually, though not always, the same as
    the `bazel-*` symlinks created in the base workspace directory after a
    successful build. However, if the workspace directory is read-only,
    no `bazel-*` symlinks can be created. Scripts that use
    the value reported by `bazel info`, instead of assuming the
    existence of the symlink, will be more robust.
*   The complete
    ["Make" environment](/reference/be/make-variables). If the `--show_make_env` flag is
    specified, all variables in the current configuration's "Make" environment
    are also displayed (such as `CC`, `GLIBC_VERSION`, etc).
    These are the variables accessed using the `$(CC)`
    or `varref("CC")` syntax inside BUILD files.

Example: the C++ compiler for the current configuration.
This is the `$(CC)` variable in the "Make" environment,
so the `--show_make_env` flag is needed.

<pre>
  % bazel info --show_make_env -c opt COMPILATION_MODE
  opt
</pre>

Example: the `bazel-bin` output directory for the current
configuration. This is guaranteed to be correct even in cases where
the `bazel-bin` symlink cannot be created for some reason
(such as if you are building from a read-only directory).

<pre>% bazel info --cpu=piii bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/piii-opt/bin
% bazel info --cpu=k8 bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/k8-opt/bin
</pre>

### `version` and `--version` {:#version}

The version command prints version details about the built Bazel
binary, including the changelist at which it was built and the date.
These are particularly useful in determining if you have the latest
Bazel, or if you are reporting bugs. Some of the interesting values
are:

*   `changelist`: the changelist at which this version of
    Bazel was released.
*   `label`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary. Very useful when reporting bugs.

`bazel --version`, with no other args, will emit the same output as
`bazel version --gnu_format`, except without the side-effect of potentially starting
a Bazel server or unpacking the server archive. `bazel --version` can be run from
anywhere - it does not require a workspace directory.

### `mobile-install` {:#mobile-install}

The `mobile-install` command installs apps to mobile devices.
Currently only Android devices running ART are supported.

See [bazel mobile-install](/docs/mobile-install) for more information.

Note: This command does not install the same thing that
`bazel build` produces: Bazel tweaks the app so that it can be
built, installed and re-installed quickly. This should, however, be mostly
transparent to the app.

The following options are supported:

#### `--incremental` {:#incremental}

If set, Bazel tries to install the app incrementally, that is, only those
parts that have changed since the last build. This cannot update resources
referenced from `AndroidManifest.xml`, native code or Java
resources (such as those referenced by `Class.getResource()`). If these
things change, this option must be omitted. Contrary to the spirit of Bazel
and due to limitations of the Android platform, it is the
**responsibility of the user** to know when this command is good enough and
when a full install is needed.

If you are using a device with Marshmallow or later, consider the
[`--split_apks`](#split-apks) flag.

#### `--split_apks` {:#split-apks}

Whether to use split apks to install and update the application on the device.
Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later. Note that the
[`--incremental`](#incremental) flag
is not necessary when using `--split_apks`.

#### `--start_app` {:#start-app}

Starts the app in a clean state after installing. Equivalent to `--start=COLD`.

#### `--debug_app` {:#debug-app}

Waits for debugger to be attached before starting the app in a clean state after installing.
Equivalent to `--start=DEBUG`.

#### `--start=_start_type_` {:#start}

How the app should be started after installing it. Supported _start_type_s are:

*   `NO` Does not start the app. This is the default.
*   `COLD` Starts the app from a clean state after install.
*   `WARM` Preserves and restores the application state on incremental installs.
*   `DEBUG` Waits for the debugger before starting the app in a clean state after
    install.

Note: If more than one of `--start=_start_type_`, `--start_app` or
`--debug_app` is set, the last value is used.

#### `--adb={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb}

Indicates the `adb` binary to be used.

The default is to use the adb in the Android SDK specified by
[`--android_sdk`](#android-sdk).

#### `--adb_arg={{ "<var>" }}serial{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb-arg}

Extra arguments to `adb`. These come before the subcommand in the
command line and are typically used to specify which device to install to.
For example, to select the Android device or emulator to use:

<pre>% bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=deadbeef
</pre>

invokes `adb` as

<pre>
adb -s deadbeef install ...
</pre>

#### `--incremental_install_verbosity={{ "<var>" }}number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#incremental-install-verbosity}

The verbosity for incremental install. Set to 1 for debug logging to be
printed to the console.

### `dump` {:#dump}

The `dump` command prints to stdout a dump of the
internal state of the Bazel server. This command is intended
primarily for use by Bazel developers, so the output of this command
is not specified, and is subject to change.

By default, command will just print help message outlining possible
options to dump specific areas of the Bazel state. In order to dump
internal state, at least one of the options must be specified.

Following options are supported:

*   `--action_cache` dumps action cache content.
*   `--packages` dumps package cache content.
*   `--skyframe` dumps state of internal Bazel dependency graph.
*   `--rules` dumps rule summary for each rule and aspect class,
    including counts and action counts. This includes both native and Starlark rules.
    If memory tracking is enabled, then the rules' memory consumption is also printed.
*   `--skylark_memory` dumps a
    [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) compatible .gz file to the specified path.
    You must enable memory tracking for this to work.

#### Memory tracking {:#memory-tracking}

Some `dump` commands require memory tracking. To turn this on, you have to pass
startup flags to Bazel:

*   `--host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`
*   `--host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1`

The java-agent is checked into Bazel at
`third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`, so
make sure you adjust `$BAZEL` for where you keep your Bazel repository.

Do not forget to keep passing these options to Bazel for every command or the server will
restart.

Example:

<pre>
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    build --nobuild &lt;targets&gt;

    # Dump rules
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --rules

    # Dump Starlark heap and analyze it with pprof
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --skylark_memory=$HOME/prof.gz
    % pprof -flame $HOME/prof.gz
</pre>

### `analyze-profile` {:#analyze-profile}

The `analyze-profile` command analyzes a
[JSON trace profile](/advanced/performance/json-trace-profile) previously
gathered during a Bazel invocation.

### `canonicalize-flags` {:#canonicalize-flags}

The [`canonicalize-flags`](/reference/command-line-reference#canonicalize-flags-options)
command, which takes a list of options for a Bazel command and returns a list of
options that has the same effect. The new list of options is canonical. For example,
two lists of options with the same effect are canonicalized to the same new list.

The `--for_command` option can be used to select between different
commands. At this time, only `build` and `test` are
supported. Options that the given command does not support cause an error.

Note: A small number of options cannot be reordered, because Bazel cannot
ensure that the effect is identical. Also note that this command
_does not_ expand flags from `--config`.

As an example:

<pre>
  % bazel canonicalize-flags -- --config=any_name --test_tag_filters="-lint"
  --config=any_name
  --test_tag_filters=-lint
</pre>

### Startup options {:#startup-options}

The options described in this section affect the startup of the Java
virtual machine used by Bazel server process, and they apply to all
subsequent commands handled by that server. If there is an already
running Bazel server and the startup options do not match, it will
be restarted.

All of the options described in this section must be specified using the
`--key=value` or `--key value`
syntax. Also, these options must appear _before_ the name of the Bazel
command. Use `startup --key=value` to list these in a `.bazelrc` file.

#### `--output_base={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-base}

This option requires a path argument, which must specify a
writable directory. Bazel will use this location to write all its
output. The output base is also the key by which the client locates
the Bazel server. By changing the output base, you change the server
which will handle the command.

By default, the output base is derived from the user's login name,
and the name of the workspace directory (actually, its MD5 digest),
so a typical value looks like:
`/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`.

Note: The client uses the output base to find the Bazel server
instance, so if you specify a different output base in a Bazel
command, a different server will be found (or started) to handle the
request. It's possible to perform two concurrent builds in the same
workspace directory by varying the output base.

For example:

<pre>
 OUTPUT_BASE=/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/custom_output_base
% bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}1 build //foo  &amp;  bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}2 build //bar
</pre>

In this command, the two Bazel commands run concurrently (because of
the shell `&amp;` operator), each using a different Bazel
server instance (because of the different output bases).
In contrast, if the default output base was used in both commands,
then both requests would be sent to the same server, which would
handle them sequentially: building `//foo` first, followed
by an incremental build of `//bar`.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--output_user_root={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-user-root}

Points to the root directory where output and install bases are created. The directory
must either not exist or be owned by the calling user. In the past,
this was allowed to point to a directory shared among various users
but it's not allowed any longer. This may be allowed once
[issue #11100](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11100){: .external} is addressed.

If the `--output_base` option is specified, it overrides
using `--output_user_root` to calculate the output base.

The install base location is calculated based on
`--output_user_root`, plus the MD5 identity of the Bazel embedded
binaries.

You can use the `--output_user_root` option to choose an
alternate base location for all of Bazel's output (install base and output
base) if there is a better location in your filesystem layout.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--server_javabase={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#server-javabase}

Specifies the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_ runs. The value must be a path to
the directory containing a JDK or JRE. It should not be a label.
This option should appear before any Bazel command, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --server_javabase=/usr/local/buildtools/java/jdk build //foo
</pre>

This flag does _not_ affect the JVMs used by Bazel subprocesses such as applications, tests,
tools, and so on. Use build options [--javabase](#javabase) or
[--host_javabase](#host-javabase) instead.

This flag was previously named `--host_javabase` (sometimes referred to as the
'left-hand side' `--host_javabase`), but was renamed to avoid confusion with the
build flag [--host_javabase](#host-javabase) (sometimes referred to as the
'right-hand side' `--host_javabase`).

#### `--host_jvm_args={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-jvm-args}

Specifies a startup option to be passed to the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_
runs. This can be used to set the stack size, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --host_jvm_args="-Xss256K" build //foo
</pre>

This option can be used multiple times with individual arguments. Note that
setting this flag should rarely be needed. You can also pass a space-separated list of strings,
each of which will be interpreted as a separate JVM argument, but this feature will soon be
deprecated.

That this does _not_ affect any JVMs used by
subprocesses of Bazel: applications, tests, tools, and so on. To pass
JVM options to executable Java programs, whether run by `bazel
run` or on the command-line, you should use
the `--jvm_flags` argument which
all `java_binary` and `java_test` programs
support. Alternatively for tests, use `bazel test --test_arg=--jvm_flags=foo ...`.

#### `--host_jvm_debug` {:#host-java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine to wait for a connection
from a JDWP-compliant debugger before
calling the main method of _Bazel itself_. This is primarily
intended for use by Bazel developers.

Note: This does _not_ affect any JVMs used by subprocesses of Bazel:
applications, tests, tools, etc.

#### `--autodetect_server_javabase` {:#autodetect-server-javabase}

This option causes Bazel to automatically search for an installed JDK on startup,
and to fall back to the installed JRE if the embedded JRE isn't available.
`--explicit_server_javabase` can be used to pick an explicit JRE to
run Bazel with.

#### `--batch` {:#batch}

Batch mode causes Bazel to not use the
[standard client/server mode](/run/client-server), but instead runs a bazel
java process for a single command, which has been used for more predictable
semantics with respect to signal handling, job control, and environment
variable inheritance, and is necessary for running bazel in a chroot jail.

Batch mode retains proper queueing semantics within the same output_base.
That is, simultaneous invocations will be processed in order, without overlap.
If a batch mode Bazel is run on a client with a running server, it first
kills the server before processing the command.

Bazel will run slower in batch mode, or with the alternatives described above.
This is because, among other things, the build file cache is memory-resident, so it is not
preserved between sequential batch invocations.
Therefore, using batch mode often makes more sense in cases where performance
is less critical, such as continuous builds.

Warning: `--batch` is sufficiently slower than standard
client/server mode. Additionally it might not support all of the features and optimizations which
are made possible by a persistent Bazel server. If you're using `--batch`
for the purpose of build isolation, you should use the command option
`--nokeep_state_after_build`, which guarantees that no incremental
in-memory state is kept between builds. In order to restart the Bazel server and JVM after a
build, please explicitly do so using the "shutdown" command.

#### `--max_idle_secs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#max-idle-secs}

This option specifies how long, in seconds, the Bazel server process
should wait after the last client request, before it exits. The
default value is 10800 (3 hours). `--max_idle_secs=0` will cause the
Bazel server process to persist indefinitely.

Note: this flag is only read if Bazel needs
to start a new server. Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.

Note: system sleep time where a build is not running is counted as idle time.

This option may be used by scripts that invoke Bazel to ensure that
they do not leave Bazel server processes on a user's machine when they
would not be running otherwise.
For example, a presubmit script might wish to
invoke `bazel query` to ensure that a user's pending
change does not introduce unwanted dependencies. However, if the
user has not done a recent build in that workspace, it would be
undesirable for the presubmit script to start a Bazel server just
for it to remain idle for the rest of the day.
By specifying a small value of `--max_idle_secs` in the
query request, the script can ensure that _if_ it caused a new
server to start, that server will exit promptly, but if instead
there was already a server running, that server will continue to run
until it has been idle for the usual time. Of course, the existing
server's idle timer will be reset.

#### `--[no]shutdown_on_low_sys_mem` {:#shutdown-on-low-sys-mem}

If enabled and `--max_idle_secs` is set to a positive duration,
after the build server has been idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is
low on memory. Linux only.

In addition to running an idle check corresponding to max_idle_secs, the build server will
starts monitoring available system memory after the server has been idle for some time.
If the available system memory becomes critically low, the server will exit.

#### `--[no]block_for_lock` {:#block-for-lock}

If enabled, Bazel will wait for other Bazel commands holding the
server lock to complete before progressing. If disabled, Bazel will
exit in error if it cannot immediately acquire the lock and
proceed.

Developers might use this in presubmit checks to avoid long waits caused
by another Bazel command in the same client.

#### `--io_nice_level={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#io-nice-level}

Sets a level from 0-7 for best-effort IO scheduling. 0 is highest priority,
7 is lowest. The anticipatory scheduler may only honor up to priority 4.
Negative values are ignored.

#### `--batch_cpu_scheduling` {:#batch-cpu-scheduling}

Use `batch` CPU scheduling for Bazel. This policy is useful for
workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value.
See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. This policy may provide for better system
interactivity at the expense of Bazel throughput.

### Miscellaneous options {:#misc-options}

#### `--[no]announce_rc` {:#announce-rc}

Controls whether Bazel announces startup options and command options read from
the bazelrc files when starting up.

#### `--color (yes|no|auto)` {:#color}

This option determines whether Bazel will use colors to highlight
its output on the screen.

If this option is set to `yes`, color output is enabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, Bazel will use color output only if
the output is being sent to a terminal and the TERM environment variable
is set to a value other than `dumb`, `emacs`, or `xterm-mono`.
If this option is set to `no`, color output is disabled,
regardless of whether the output is going to a terminal and regardless
of the setting of the TERM environment variable.

#### `--config={{ "<var>" }}name{{ "</var>" }}` {:#config}

Selects additional config section from
[the rc files](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-file-locations); for the current `command`,
it also pulls in the options from `command:name` if such a section exists. Can be
specified multiple times to add flags from several config sections. Expansions can refer to other
definitions (for example, expansions can be chained).

#### `--curses (yes|no|auto)` {:#curses}

This option determines whether Bazel will use cursor controls
in its screen output. This results in less scrolling data, and a more
compact, easy-to-read stream of output from Bazel. This works well with
`--color`.

If this option is set to `yes`, use of cursor controls is enabled.
If this option is set to `no`, use of cursor controls is disabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, use of cursor controls will be
enabled under the same conditions as for `--color=auto`.

#### `--[no]show_timestamps` {:#show-timestamps}

If specified, a timestamp is added to each message generated by
Bazel specifying the time at which the message was displayed.

# Sandboxing

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This article covers sandboxing in Bazel and debugging your sandboxing
environment.

*Sandboxing* is a permission restricting strategy that isolates processes from
each other or from resources in a system. For Bazel, this means restricting file
system access.

Bazel's file system sandbox runs processes in a working directory that only
contains known inputs, such that compilers and other tools don't see source
files they should not access, unless they know the absolute paths to them.

Sandboxing doesn't hide the host environment in any way. Processes can freely
access all files on the file system. However, on platforms that support user
namespaces, processes can't modify any files outside their working directory.
This ensures that the build graph doesn't have hidden dependencies that could
affect the reproducibility of the build.

More specifically, Bazel constructs an `execroot/` directory for each action,
which acts as the action's work directory at execution time. `execroot/`
contains all input files to the action and serves as the container for any
generated outputs. Bazel then uses an operating-system-provided technique,
containers on Linux and `sandbox-exec` on macOS, to constrain the action within
`execroot/`.

## Reasons for sandboxing {:#sandboxing-reasons}

-   Without action sandboxing, Bazel doesn't know if a tool uses undeclared
    input files (files that are not explicitly listed in the dependencies of an
    action). When one of the undeclared input files changes, Bazel still
    believes that the build is up-to-date and won’t rebuild the action. This can
    result in an incorrect incremental build.

-   Incorrect reuse of cache entries creates problems during remote caching. A
    bad cache entry in a shared cache affects every developer on the project,
    and wiping the entire remote cache is not a feasible solution.

-   Sandboxing mimics the behavior of remote execution — if a build works well
    with sandboxing, it will likely also work with remote execution. By making
    remote execution upload all necessary files (including local tools), you can
    significantly reduce maintenance costs for compile clusters compared to
    having to install the tools on every machine in the cluster every time you
    want to try out a new compiler or make a change to an existing tool.

## What sandbox strategy to use {:#sandboxing-strategies}

You can choose which kind of sandboxing to use, if any, with the
[strategy flags](user-manual.html#strategy-options). Using the `sandboxed`
strategy makes Bazel pick one of the sandbox implementations listed below,
preferring an OS-specific sandbox to the less hermetic generic one.
[Persistent workers](/remote/persistent) run in a generic sandbox if you pass
the `--worker_sandboxing` flag.

The `local` (a.k.a. `standalone`) strategy does not do any kind of sandboxing.
It simply executes the action's command line with the working directory set to
the execroot of your workspace.

`processwrapper-sandbox` is a sandboxing strategy that does not require any
"advanced" features - it should work on any POSIX system out of the box. It
builds a sandbox directory consisting of symlinks that point to the original
source files, executes the action's command line with the working directory set
to this directory instead of the execroot, then moves the known output artifacts
out of the sandbox into the execroot and deletes the sandbox. This prevents the
action from accidentally using any input files that are not declared and from
littering the execroot with unknown output files.

`linux-sandbox` goes one step further and builds on top of the
`processwrapper-sandbox`. Similar to what Docker does under the hood, it uses
Linux Namespaces (User, Mount, PID, Network and IPC namespaces) to isolate the
action from the host. That is, it makes the entire filesystem read-only except
for the sandbox directory, so the action cannot accidentally modify anything on
the host filesystem. This prevents situations like a buggy test accidentally rm
-rf'ing your $HOME directory. Optionally, you can also prevent the action from
accessing the network. `linux-sandbox` uses PID namespaces to prevent the action
from seeing any other processes and to reliably kill all processes (even daemons
spawned by the action) at the end.

`darwin-sandbox` is similar, but for macOS. It uses Apple's `sandbox-exec` tool
to achieve roughly the same as the Linux sandbox.

Both the `linux-sandbox` and the `darwin-sandbox` do not work in a "nested"
scenario due to restrictions in the mechanisms provided by the operating
systems. Because Docker also uses Linux namespaces for its container magic, you
cannot easily run `linux-sandbox` inside a Docker container, unless you use
`docker run --privileged`. On macOS, you cannot run `sandbox-exec` inside a
process that's already being sandboxed. Thus, in these cases, Bazel
automatically falls back to using `processwrapper-sandbox`.

If you would rather get a build error — such as to not accidentally build with a
less strict execution strategy — explicitly modify the list of execution
strategies that Bazel tries to use (for example, `bazel build
--spawn_strategy=worker,linux-sandbox`).

Dynamic execution usually requires sandboxing for local execution. To opt out,
pass the `--experimental_local_lockfree_output` flag. Dynamic execution silently
sandboxes [persistent workers](/remote/persistent).

## Downsides to sandboxing {:#sandboxing_downsides}

-   Sandboxing incurs extra setup and teardown cost. How big this cost is
    depends on many factors, including the shape of the build and the
    performance of the host OS. For Linux, sandboxed builds are rarely more than
    a few percent slower. Setting `--reuse_sandbox_directories` can
    mitigate the setup and teardown cost.

-   Sandboxing effectively disables any cache the tool may have. You can
    mitigate this by using [persistent workers](/remote/persistent), at
    the cost of weaker sandbox guarantees.

-   [Multiplex workers](/remote/multiplex) require explicit worker support
    to be sandboxed. Workers that do not support multiplex sandboxing run as
    singleplex workers under dynamic execution, which can cost extra memory.

## Debugging {:#debugging}

Follow the strategies below to debug issues with sandboxing.

### Deactivated namespaces {:#deactivated-namespaces}

On some platforms, such as
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/){: .external}
cluster nodes or Debian, user namespaces are deactivated by default due to
security concerns. If the `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` file
exists and contains a 0, you can activate user namespaces by running:

```posix-terminal
   sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

### Rule execution failures {:#rule-failures}

The sandbox may fail to execute rules because of the system setup. If you see a
message like `namespace-sandbox.c:633: execvp(argv[0], argv): No such file or
directory`, try to deactivate the sandbox with `--strategy=Genrule=local` for
genrules, and `--spawn_strategy=local` for other rules.

### Detailed debugging for build failures {:#debugging-build-failures}

If your build failed, use `--verbose_failures` and `--sandbox_debug` to make
Bazel show the exact command it ran when your build failed, including the part
that sets up the sandbox.

Example error message:

```
ERROR: path/to/your/project/BUILD:1:1: compilation of rule
'//path/to/your/project:all' failed:

Sandboxed execution failed, which may be legitimate (such as a compiler error),
or due to missing dependencies. To enter the sandbox environment for easier
debugging, run the following command in parentheses. On command failure, a bash
shell running inside the sandbox will then automatically be spawned

namespace-sandbox failed: error executing command
  (cd /some/path && \
  exec env - \
    LANG=en_US \
    PATH=/some/path/bin:/bin:/usr/bin \
    PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/some/path \
  /some/path/namespace-sandbox @/sandbox/root/path/this-sandbox-name.params --
  /some/path/to/your/some-compiler --some-params some-target)
```

You can now inspect the generated sandbox directory and see which files Bazel
created and run the command again to see how it behaves.

Note that Bazel does not delete the sandbox directory when you use
`--sandbox_debug`. Unless you are actively debugging, you should disable
`--sandbox_debug` because it fills up your disk over time.

# Apple Apps and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel to build macOS and iOS
projects. It links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to
using Bazel to build and test for those platforms.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on macOS and iOS projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building an iOS app](/start/ios-app)
*  [Objective-C build rules](/reference/be/objective-c)
*  [General Apple rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple){: .external}
*  [Integration with Xcode](/install/ide)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your macOS and iOS projects with Xcode, follow the steps
in the migration guide to start building them with Bazel:

*  [Migrating from Xcode to Bazel](/migrate/xcode)

## Apple apps and new rules {:#apple-apps-new-rules}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios.
You do not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts)
when building your macOS and iOS projects:

*  Modules:

   *  [`apple_bitcode_mode`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_bitcode_mode)
   *  [`apple_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/apple_common)
   *  [`apple_platform`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform)
   *  [`apple_platform_type`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform_type)
   *  [`apple_toolchain`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_toolchain)

*  Configuration fragments:

   *  [`apple`](/rules/lib/fragments/apple)

*  Providers:

   *  [`ObjcProvider`](/rules/lib/providers/ObjcProvider)
   *  [`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig)

## Xcode selection {:#xcode-selection}

If your build requires Xcode, Bazel will select an appropriate version based on
the `--xcode_config` and `--xcode_version` flags. The `--xcode_config` consumes
the set of available Xcode versions and sets a default version if
`--xcode_version` is not passed. This default is overridden by the
`--xcode_version` flag, as long as it is set to an Xcode version that is
represented in the `--xcode_config` target.

If you do not pass `--xcode_config`, Bazel will use the autogenerated
[`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig) that represents the
Xcode versions available on your host machine. The default version is
the newest available Xcode version. This is appropriate for local execution.

If you are performing remote builds, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `versions` attribute is a list of remotely available
[`xcode_version`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version)
targets, and whose `default` attribute is one of these
[`xcode_versions`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version).

If you are using dynamic execution, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `remote_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the remotely available Xcode versions, and whose
`local_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the locally available Xcode versions. For `local_versions`,
you probably want to use the autogenerated
`@local_config_xcode//:host_available_xcodes`. The default Xcode version is the
newest mutually available version, if there is one, otherwise the default of the
`local_versions` target. If you prefer to use the `local_versions` default
as the default, you can pass `--experimental_prefer_mutual_default=false`.

## Java versions {:#java-versions}

There are two relevant versions of Java that are set with configuration flags:

*   the version of the source files in the repository
*   the version of the Java runtime that is used to execute the code and to test
    it

### Configuring the version of the source code in your repository {:#config-source-code}

Without an additional configuration, Bazel assumes all Java source files in the
repository are written in a single Java version. To specify the version of the
sources in the repository add `build --java_language_version={ver}` to
`.bazelrc` file, where `{ver}` is for example `11`. Bazel repository owners
should set this flag so that Bazel and its users can reference the source code's
Java version number. For more details, see
[Java language version flag](/docs/user-manual#java-language-version).

### Configuring the JVM used to execute and test the code {:#config-jvm}

Bazel uses one JDK for compilation and another JVM to execute and test the code.

By default Bazel compiles the code using a JDK it downloads and it executes and
tests the code with the JVM installed on the local machine. Bazel searches for
the JVM using `JAVA_HOME` or path.

The resulting binaries are compatible with locally installed JVM in system
libraries, which means the resulting binaries depend on what is installed on the
machine.

To configure the JVM used for execution and testing use `--java_runtime_version`
flag. The default value is `local_jdk`.

### Hermetic testing and compilation {:#hermetic-testing}

To create a hermetic compile, you can use command line flag
`--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11`. The code is compiled for, executed, and
tested on the JVM downloaded from a remote repository. For more details, see
[Java runtime version flag](/docs/user-manual#java_runtime_version).

### Configuring compilation and execution of build tools in Java {:#config-build-tools-java}

There is a second pair of JDK and JVM used to build and execute tools, which are
used in the build process, but are not in the build results. That JDK and JVM
are controlled using `--tool_java_language_version` and
`--tool_java_runtime_version`. Default values are `11` and `remotejdk_11`,
respectively.

#### Compiling using locally installed JDK {:#compile-using-jdk}

Bazel by default compiles using remote JDK, because it is overriding JDK's
internals. The compilation toolchains using locally installed JDK are configured,
however not used.

To compile using locally installed JDK, that is use the compilation toolchains
for local JDK, use additional flag `--extra_toolchains=@local_jdk//:all`,
however, mind that this may not work on JDK of arbitrary vendors.

For more details, see
[configuring Java toolchains](#config-java-toolchains).

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to Java projects.

### Directory structure {:#directory-structure}

Prefer Maven's standard directory layout (sources under `src/main/java`, tests
under `src/test/java`).

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow these guidelines when creating your `BUILD` files:

*   Use one `BUILD` file per directory containing Java sources, because this
    improves build performance.

*   Every `BUILD` file should contain one `java_library` rule that looks like
    this:

    ```python
    java_library(
        name = "directory-name",
        srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
        deps = [...],
    )
    ```

*   The name of the library should be the name of the directory containing the
    `BUILD` file. This makes the label of the library shorter, that is use
    `"//package"` instead of `"//package:package"`.

*   The sources should be a non-recursive [`glob`](/reference/be/functions#glob) of
    all Java files in the directory.

*   Tests should be in a matching directory under `src/test` and depend on this
    library.

## Creating new rules for advanced Java builds {:#rules-advanced-java-builds}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios. You do
not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts) when building your Java
projects:

*   Main Java module: [`java_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/java_common)
*   Main Java provider: [`JavaInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaInfo)
*   Configuration fragment: [`java`](/rules/lib/fragments/java)
*   Other modules:

    *   [`java_annotation_processing`](/rules/lib/builtins/java_annotation_processing)
    *   [`java_compilation_info`](/rules/lib/providers/java_compilation_info)
    *   [`java_output_jars`](/rules/lib/providers/java_output_jars)
    *   [`JavaRuntimeInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaRuntimeInfo)
    *   [`JavaToolchainInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaToolchainInfo)

## Configuring the Java toolchains {:#config-java-toolchains}

Bazel uses two types of Java toolchains:
- execution, used to execute and test Java binaries, controlled with
  `--java_runtime_version` flag
- compilation, used to compile Java sources, controlled with
  `--java_language_version` flag

### Configuring additional execution toolchains {:#config-execution-toolchains}

Execution toolchain is the JVM, either local or from a repository, with some
additional information about its version, operating system, and CPU
architecture.

Java execution toolchains may added using the `local_java_repository` or
`remote_java_repository` repo rules in a module extension. Adding the rule makes
the JVM available using a flag. When multiple definitions for the same operating
system and CPU architecture are given, the first one is used.

Example configuration of local JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:local_java_repository.bzl", "local_java_repository")

local_java_repository(
  name = "additionaljdk",          # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk, --java_runtime_version=11 or --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk_11
  version = 11,                    # Optional, if not set it is autodetected
  java_home = "/usr/lib/jdk-15/",  # Path to directory containing bin/java
)
```

Example configuration of remote JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:remote_java_repository.bzl", "remote_java_repository")

remote_java_repository(
  name = "openjdk_canary_linux_arm",
  prefix = "openjdk_canary", # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=openjdk_canary_11
  version = "11",            # or --java_runtime_version=11
  target_compatible_with = [ # Specifies constraints this JVM is compatible with
    "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    "@platforms//os:linux",
  ],
  urls = ...,               # Other parameters are from http_repository rule.
  sha256 = ...,
  strip_prefix = ...
)
```

### Configuring additional compilation toolchains {:#config-compilation-toolchains}

Compilation toolchain is composed of JDK and multiple tools that Bazel uses
during the compilation and that provides additional features, such as: Error
Prone, strict Java dependencies, header compilation, Android desugaring,
coverage instrumentation, and genclass handling for IDEs.

JavaBuilder is a Bazel-bundled tool that executes compilation, and provides the
aforementioned features. Actual compilation is executed using the internal
compiler by the JDK. The JDK used for compilation is specified by `java_runtime`
attribute of the toolchain.

Bazel overrides some JDK internals. In case of JDK version > 9,
`java.compiler` and `jdk.compiler` modules are patched using JDK's flag
`--patch_module`. In case of JDK version 8, the Java compiler is patched using
`-Xbootclasspath` flag.

VanillaJavaBuilder is a second implementation of JavaBuilder,
which does not modify JDK's internal compiler and does not have any of the
additional features. VanillaJavaBuilder is not used by any of the built-in
toolchains.

In addition to JavaBuilder, Bazel uses several other tools during compilation.

The `ijar` tool processes `jar` files to remove everything except call
signatures. Resulting jars are called header jars. They are used to improve the
compilation incrementality by only recompiling downstream dependents when the
body of a function changes.

The `singlejar` tool packs together multiple `jar` files into a single one.

The `genclass` tool post-processes the output of a Java compilation, and produces
a `jar` containing only the class files for sources that were generated by
annotation processors.

The `JacocoRunner` tool runs Jacoco over instrumented files and outputs results in
LCOV format.

The `TestRunner` tool executes JUnit 4 tests in a controlled environment.

You can reconfigure the compilation by adding `default_java_toolchain` macro to
a `BUILD` file and registering it either by adding `register_toolchains` rule to
the `MODULE.bazel` file or by using
[`--extra_toolchains`](/docs/user-manual#extra-toolchains) flag.

The toolchain is only used when the `source_version` attribute matches the
value specified by `--java_language_version` flag.

Example toolchain configuration:

```python
load(
  "@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl",
  "default_java_toolchain", "DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION", "BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS", "DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS"
)

default_java_toolchain(
  name = "repository_default_toolchain",
  configuration = DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION,        # One of predefined configurations
                                                          # Other parameters are from java_toolchain rule:
  java_runtime = "@rules_java//toolchains:remote_jdk11", # JDK to use for compilation and toolchain's tools execution
  jvm_opts = BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional JDK options
  javacopts = DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional javac options
  source_version = "9",
)
```

which can be used using `--extra_toolchains=//:repository_default_toolchain_definition`
or by adding `register_toolchains("//:repository_default_toolchain_definition")`
to the workpace.

Predefined configurations:

-   `DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: all features, supports JDK versions >= 9
-   `VANILLA_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: no additional features, supports JDKs of
    arbitrary vendors.
-   `PREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but only use prebuilt
    tools (`ijar`, `singlejar`)
-   `NONPREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but all tools are
    built from sources (this may be useful on operating system with different
    libc)

#### Configuring JVM and Java compiler flags {:#config-jvm}

You may configure JVM and javac flags either with flags or with
 `default_java_toolchain` attributes.

The relevant flags are `--jvmopt`, `--host_jvmopt`, `--javacopt`,  and
`--host_javacopt`.

The relevant `default_java_toolchain` attributes are `javacopts`, `jvm_opts`,
`javabuilder_jvm_opts`, and `turbine_jvm_opts`.

#### Package specific Java compiler flags configuration {:#package-java-compiler-flags}

You can configure different Java compiler flags for specific source
files using `package_configuration` attribute of `default_java_toolchain`.
Please refer to the example below.

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl", "default_java_toolchain")

# This is a convenience macro that inherits values from Bazel's default java_toolchain
default_java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    package_configuration = [
        ":error_prone",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# This associates a set of javac flags with a set of packages
java_package_configuration(
    name = "error_prone",
    javacopts = [
        "-Xep:MissingOverride:ERROR",
    ],
    packages = ["error_prone_packages"],
)

# This is a regular package_group, which is used to specify a set of packages to apply flags to
package_group(
    name = "error_prone_packages",
    packages = [
        "//foo/...",
        "-//foo/bar/...", # this is an exclusion
    ],
)
```

#### Multiple versions of Java source code in a single repository {:#java-source-single-repo}

Bazel only supports compiling a single version of Java sources in a build.
build. This means that when building a Java test or an application, all
 dependencies are built against the same Java version.

However, separate builds may be executed using different flags.

To make the task of using different flags easier, sets of flags for a specific
version may be grouped with `.bazelrc` configs":

```python
build:java8 --java_language_version=8
build:java8 --java_runtime_version=local_jdk_8
build:java11 --java_language_version=11
build:java11 --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11
```

These configs can be used with the `--config` flag, for example
`bazel test --config=java11 //:java11_test`.

# Android Instrumentation Tests

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

![Running Android instrumentation tests in parallel](/docs/images/android_test.gif "Android instrumentation test")

**Figure 1.** Running parallel Android instrumentation tests.

[`android_instrumentation_test`](/reference/be/android#android_instrumentation_test)
allows developers to test their apps on Android emulators and devices.
It utilizes real Android framework APIs and the Android Test Library.

For hermeticity and reproducibility, Bazel creates and launches Android
emulators in a sandbox, ensuring that tests always run from a clean state. Each
test gets an isolated emulator instance, allowing tests to run in parallel
without passing states between them.

For more information on Android instrumentation tests, check out the [Android
developer
documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests.html){: .external}.

Please file issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues){: .external}.

## How it works {:#how-it-works}

When you run `bazel test` on an `android_instrumentation_test` target for the
first time, Bazel performs the following steps:

1. Builds the test APK, APK under test, and their transitive dependencies
2. Creates, boots, and caches clean emulator states
3. Starts the emulator
4. Installs the APKs
5. Runs tests utilizing the [Android Test Orchestrator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator){: .external}
6. Shuts down the emulator
7. Reports the results

In subsequent test runs, Bazel boots the emulator from the clean, cached state
created in step 2, so there are no leftover states from previous runs. Caching
emulator state also speeds up test runs.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Ensure your environment satisfies the following prerequisites:

- **Linux**. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, and 18.04.

- **Bazel 0.12.0** or later. Verify the version by running `bazel info release`.

```posix-terminal
bazel info release
```
This results in output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
release 4.1.0
```

- **KVM**. Bazel requires emulators to have [hardware
  acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#accel-check){: .external}
  with KVM on Linux. You can follow these
  [installation instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation){: .external}
  for Ubuntu.

To verify that KVM has the correct configuration, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install cpu-checker && kvm-ok
```

If it prints the following message, you have the correct configuration:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

- **Xvfb**. To run headless tests (for example, on CI servers), Bazel requires
  the [X virtual framebuffer](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml).

To install it, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install xvfb
```
Verify that `Xvfb` is installed correctly and is installed at `/usr/bin/Xvfb`
by running:

```posix-terminal
which Xvfb
```
The output is the following:

```{:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
/usr/bin/Xvfb
```

- **32-bit Libraries**. Some of the binaries used by the test infrastructure are
  32-bit, so on 64-bit machines, ensure that 32-bit binaries can be run. For
  Ubuntu, install these 32-bit libraries:

```posix-terminal
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

## Getting started {:#getting-started}

Here is a typical target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`:

![The target dependency graph on an Android instrumentation test](/docs/images/android_instrumentation_test.png "Target dependency graph")

**Figure 2.** Target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`.


### BUILD file {:#build-file}

The graph translates into a `BUILD` file like this:

```python
android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test",
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86",
)

# Test app and library
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = ":my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidTestManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_test_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_test_lib",
    srcs = glob(["javatest/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        ":my_app_lib",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
    ],
    # ...
)

# Target app and library under test
android_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_app_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_app_lib",
    srcs = glob(["java/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@maven//:androidx_appcompat_appcompat",
        "@maven//:androidx_annotation_annotation",
    ]
    # ...
)
```

The main attributes of the rule `android_instrumentation_test` are:

- `test_app`: An `android_binary` target. This target contains test code and
  dependencies like Espresso and UIAutomator. The selected `android_binary`
  target is required to specify an `instruments` attribute pointing to another
  `android_binary`, which is the app under test.

- `target_device`: An `android_device` target. This target describes the
  specifications of the Android emulator which Bazel uses to create, launch and
  run the tests. See the [section on choosing an Android
  device](#android-device-target) for more information.

The test app's `AndroidManifest.xml` must include [an `<instrumentation>`
tag](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/#configure_instrumentation_manifest_settings){: .external}.
This tag must specify the attributes for the **package of the target app** and
the **fully qualified class name of the instrumentation test runner**,
`androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`.

Here is an example `AndroidTestManifest.xml` for the test app:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="com.example.android.app.test"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">

    <instrumentation
        android:name="androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        android:targetPackage="com.example.android.app" />

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="16"
        android:targetSdkVersion="27" />

    <application >
       <!-- ... -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### WORKSPACE dependencies {:#workspace-dependencies}

In order to use this rule, your project needs to depend on these external
repositories:

- `@androidsdk`: The Android SDK. Download this through Android Studio.

- `@android_test_support`: Hosts the test runner, emulator launcher, and
  `android_device` targets. You can find the [latest release
  here](https://github.com/android/android-test/releases){: .external}.

Enable these dependencies by adding the following lines to your `WORKSPACE`
file:

```python
# Android SDK
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # or set ANDROID_HOME
)

# Android Test Support
ATS_COMMIT = "$COMMIT_HASH"
http_archive(
    name = "android_test_support",
    strip_prefix = "android-test-%s" % ATS_COMMIT,
    urls = ["https://github.com/android/android-test/archive/%s.tar.gz" % ATS_COMMIT],
)
load("@android_test_support//:repo.bzl", "android_test_repositories")
android_test_repositories()
```

## Maven dependencies {:#maven-dependencies}

For managing dependencies on Maven artifacts from repositories, such as [Google
Maven](https://maven.google.com){: .external} or [Maven Central](https://central.maven.org){: .external},
you should use a Maven resolver, such as
[`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external){: .external}.

The rest of this page shows how to use `rules_jvm_external` to
resolve and fetch dependencies from Maven repositories.

## Choosing an android_device target {:#android-device-target}

`android_instrumentation_test.target_device` specifies which Android device to
run the tests on. These `android_device` targets are defined in
[`@android_test_support`](https://github.com/google/android-testing-support-library/tree/master/tools/android/emulated_devices){: .external}.

For example, you can query for the sources for a particular target by running:

```posix-terminal
bazel query --output=build @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86
```
Which results in output that looks similar to:

```python
# .../external/android_test_support/tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43:1
android_device(
  name = "android_23_x86",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
  tags = ["requires-kvm"],
  generator_name = "generic_phone",
  generator_function = "make_device",
  generator_location = "tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43",
  vertical_resolution = 800,
  horizontal_resolution = 480,
  ram = 2048,
  screen_density = 240,
  cache = 32,
  vm_heap = 256,
  system_image = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86_images",
  default_properties = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:_android_23_x86_props",
)
```

The device target names use this template:

```
@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/{{ "<var>" }}device_type{{ "</var>" }}:{{ "<var>" }}system{{ "</var>" }}_{{ "<var>" }}api_level{{ "</var>" }}_x86_qemu2
```

In order to launch an `android_device`, the `system_image` for the selected API
level is required. To download the system image, use Android SDK's
`tools/bin/sdkmanager`. For example, to download the system image for
`generic_phone:android_23_x86`, run `$sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager
"system-images;android-23;default;x86"`.

To see the full list of supported `android_device` targets in
`@android_test_support`, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel query 'filter("x86_qemu2$", kind(android_device, @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/...:*))'
```

Bazel currently supports x86-based emulators only. For better performance, use
`QEMU2` `android_device` targets instead of `QEMU` ones.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To run tests, add these lines to your project's
`{{ '<var>' }}project root{{ '</var>' }}:{{ '<var>' }}/.bazelrc` file.

```
# Configurations for testing with Bazel
# Select a configuration by running
# `bazel test //my:target --config={headless, gui, local_device}`

# Headless instrumentation tests (No GUI)
test:headless --test_arg=--enable_display=false

# Graphical instrumentation tests. Ensure that $DISPLAY is set.
test:gui --test_env=DISPLAY
test:gui --test_arg=--enable_display=true

# Testing with a local emulator or device. Ensure that `adb devices` lists the
# device.
# Run tests serially.
test:local_device --test_strategy=exclusive
# Use the local device broker type, as opposed to WRAPPED_EMULATOR.
test:local_device --test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER
# Uncomment and set $device_id if there is more than one connected device.
# test:local_device --test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id
```

Then, use one of the configurations to run tests:

- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=gui`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=headless`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=local_device`

Use __only one configuration__ or tests will fail.

### Headless testing {:#headless-testing}

With `Xvfb`, it is possible to test with emulators without the graphical
interface, also known as headless testing. To disable the graphical interface
when running tests, pass the test argument `--enable_display=false` to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=false
```

### GUI testing {:#gui-testing}

If the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set, it's possible to enable the
graphical interface of the emulator while the test is running. To do this, pass
these test arguments to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=true --test_env=DISPLAY
```

### Testing with a local emulator or device {:#testing-local-emulator}

Bazel also supports testing directly on a locally launched emulator or connected
device. Pass the flags
`--test_strategy=exclusive` and
`--test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER` to enable local testing mode.
If there is more than one connected device, pass the flag
`--test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id` where `$device_id` is the id of
the device/emulator listed in `adb devices`.

## Sample projects {:#sample-projects}

If you are looking for canonical project samples, see the [Android testing
samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing#experimental-bazel-support){: .external}
for projects using Espresso and UIAutomator.

## Espresso setup {:#espresso-setup}

If you write UI tests with [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/){: .external}
(`androidx.test.espresso`), you can use the following snippets to set up your
Bazel workspace with the list of commonly used Espresso artifacts and their
dependencies:

```
androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core
androidx.test:rules
androidx.test:runner
javax.inject:javax.inject
org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest
junit:junit
```

One way to organize these dependencies is to create a `//:test_deps` shared
library in your `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/BUILD.bazel` file:

```python
java_library(
    name = "test_deps",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    exports = [
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_rules",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:javax_inject_javax_inject"
        "@maven//:org_hamcrest_java_hamcrest",
        "@maven//:junit_junit",
    ],
)
```

Then, add the required dependencies in `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/WORKSPACE`:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "2.8"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "79c9850690d7614ecdb72d68394f994fef7534b292c4867ce5e7dec0aa7bdfad"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
)

load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "junit:junit:4.12",
        "javax.inject:javax.inject:1",
        "org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest:2.0.0.0"
        "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1",
        "androidx.test:rules:aar:1.1.1",
        "androidx.test:runner:aar:1.1.1",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://maven.google.com",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
)
```

Finally, in your test `android_binary` target, add the `//:test_deps`
dependency:

```python
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = "//path/to:app",
    deps = [
        "//:test_deps",
        # ...
    ],
    # ...
)
```

## Tips {:#tips}

### Reading test logs {:#reading-test-logs}

Use `--test_output=errors` to print logs for failing tests, or
`--test_output=all` to print all test output. If you're looking for an
individual test log, go to
`$PROJECT_ROOT/bazel-testlogs/path/to/InstrumentationTestTargetName`.

For example, the test logs for `BasicSample` canonical project are in
`bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest`, run:

```posix-terminal
tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest
```
This results in the following output:

```none

$ tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest

### Reading emulator logs {:#reading-emulator-logs}

The emulator logs for `android_device` targets are stored in the `/tmp/`
directory with the name `emulator_xxxxx.log`, where `xxxxx` is a
randomly-generated sequence of characters.

Use this command to find the latest emulator log:

```posix-terminal
ls -1t /tmp/emulator_*.log | head -n 1
```

### Testing against multiple API levels {:#testing-multiple-apis}

If you would like to test against multiple API levels, you can use a list
comprehension to create test targets for each API level. For example:

```python
API_LEVELS = [
    "19",
    "20",
    "21",
    "22",
]

[android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test_%s" % API_LEVEL,
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_%s_x86_qemu2" % API_LEVEL,
) for API_LEVEL in API_LEVELS]
```

## Known issues {:#known-issues}

- [Forked adb server processes are not terminated after
  tests](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4853){: .external}
- While APK building works on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), testing
  only works on Linux.
- Even with `--config=local_adb`, users still need to specify
  `android_instrumentation_test.target_device`.
- If using a local device or emulator, Bazel does not uninstall the APKs after
  the test. Clean the packages by running this command:

```posix-terminal
adb shell pm list
packages com.example.android.testing | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '\r' | xargs
-L1 -t adb uninstall
```

# C++ and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with C++ projects. It links
to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building C++
projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on C++ projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building a C++ project](/start/cpp)
*  [C++ common use cases](/tutorials/cpp-use-cases)
*  [C/C++ rules](/reference/be/c-cpp)
*  Essential Libraries
   -  [Abseil](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/quickstart){: .external}
   -  [Boost](https://github.com/nelhage/rules_boost){: .external}
   -  [HTTPS Requests: CPR and libcurl](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-make-cc-https-easy){: .external}
*  [C++ toolchain configuration](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference)
*  [Tutorial: Configuring C++ toolchains](/tutorials/ccp-toolchain-config)
*  [Integrating with C++ rules](/configure/integrate-cpp)

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to C++ projects.

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow the guidelines below when creating your BUILD files:

*  Each `BUILD` file should contain one [`cc_library`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library)
   rule target per compilation unit in the directory.

*  You should granularize your C++ libraries as much as
   possible to maximize incrementality and parallelize the build.

*  If there is a single source file in `srcs`, name the library the same as
   that C++ file's name. This library should contain C++ file(s), any matching
   header file(s), and the library's direct dependencies. For example:

   ```python
   cc_library(
       name = "mylib",
       srcs = ["mylib.cc"],
       hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
       deps = [":lower-level-lib"]
   )
   ```

*  Use one `cc_test` rule target per `cc_library` target in the file. Name the
   target `[library-name]_test` and the source file `[library-name]_test.cc`.
   For example, a test target for the `mylib` library target shown above would
   look like this:

   ```python
   cc_test(
       name = "mylib_test",
       srcs = ["mylib_test.cc"],
       deps = [":mylib"]
   )
   ```

### Include paths {:#include-paths}

Follow these guidelines for include paths:

*  Make all include paths relative to the workspace directory.

*  Use quoted includes (`#include "foo/bar/baz.h"`) for non-system headers, not
   angle-brackets (`#include <foo/bar/baz.h>`).

*  Avoid using UNIX directory shortcuts, such as `.` (current directory) or `..`
   (parent directory).

*  For legacy or `third_party` code that requires includes pointing outside the
   project repository, such as external repository includes requiring a prefix,
   use the [`include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.include_prefix) and
   [`strip_include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.strip_include_prefix)
   arguments on the `cc_library` rule target.

### Toolchain features {:#toolchain-features}

The following optional [features](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#features)
can improve the hygiene of a C++ project. They can be enabled using the
`--features` command-line flag or the `features` attribute of
[`repo`](/external/overview#repo.bazel),
[`package`](/reference/be/functions#package) or `cc_*` rules:

* The `parse_headers` feature makes it so that the C++ compiler is used to parse
  (but not compile) all header files in the built targets and their dependencies
  when using the
  [`--process_headers_in_dependencies`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--process_headers_in_dependencies)
  flag. This can help catch issues in header-only libraries and ensure that
  headers are self-contained and independent of the order in which they are
  included.
* The `layering_check` feature enforces that targets only include headers
  provided by their direct dependencies. The default toolchain supports this
  feature on Linux with `clang` as the compiler.


Project: /_project.yaml
Book: /_book.yaml

# Configurable Build Attributes

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

**_Configurable attributes_**, commonly known as [`select()`](
/reference/be/functions#select), is a Bazel feature that lets users toggle the values
of build rule attributes at the command line.

This can be used, for example, for a multiplatform library that automatically
chooses the appropriate implementation for the architecture, or for a
feature-configurable binary that can be customized at build time.

## Example {:#configurable-build-example}

```python
# myapp/BUILD

cc_binary(
    name = "mybinary",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = select({
        ":arm_build": [":arm_lib"],
        ":x86_debug_build": [":x86_dev_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":generic_lib"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "arm_build",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_debug_build",
    values = {
        "cpu": "x86",
        "compilation_mode": "dbg",
    },
)
```

This declares a `cc_binary` that "chooses" its deps based on the flags at the
command line. Specifically, `deps` becomes:

<table>
  <tr style="background: #E9E9E9; font-weight: bold">
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>deps =</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=arm</code></td>
    <td><code>[":arm_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=x86</code></td>
    <td><code>[":x86_dev_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

`select()` serves as a placeholder for a value that will be chosen based on
*configuration conditions*, which are labels referencing [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)
targets. By using `select()` in a configurable attribute, the attribute
effectively adopts different values when different conditions hold.

Matches must be unambiguous: if multiple conditions match then either:

*  They all resolve to the same value. For example, when running on linux x86, this is unambiguous
   `{"@platforms//os:linux": "Hello", "@platforms//cpu:x86_64": "Hello"}` because both branches resolve to "hello".
*  One's `values` is a strict superset of all others'. For example, `values = {"cpu": "x86", "compilation_mode": "dbg"}`
   is an unambiguous specialization of `values = {"cpu": "x86"}`.

The built-in condition [`//conditions:default`](#default-condition) automatically matches when
nothing else does.

While this example uses `deps`, `select()` works just as well on `srcs`,
`resources`, `cmd`, and most other attributes. Only a small number of attributes
are *non-configurable*, and these are clearly annotated. For example,
`config_setting`'s own
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute is non-configurable.

## `select()` and dependencies {:#select-and-dependencies}

Certain attributes change the build parameters for all transitive dependencies
under a target. For example, `genrule`'s `tools` changes `--cpu` to the CPU of
the machine running Bazel (which, thanks to cross-compilation, may be different
than the CPU the target is built for). This is known as a
[configuration transition](/reference/glossary#transition).

Given

```python
#myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "arm_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

genrule(
    name = "my_genrule",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["g_arm.src"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["g_x86.src"],
    }),
    tools = select({
        ":arm_cpu": [":tool1"],
        ":x86_cpu": [":tool2"],
    }),
)

cc_binary(
    name = "tool1",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["armtool.cc"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["x86tool.cc"],
    }),
)
```

running

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_genrule --cpu=arm
```

on an `x86` developer machine binds the build to `g_arm.src`, `tool1`, and
`x86tool.cc`. Both of the `select`s attached to `my_genrule` use `my_genrule`'s
build parameters, which include `--cpu=arm`. The `tools` attribute changes
`--cpu` to `x86` for `tool1` and its transitive dependencies. The `select` on
`tool1` uses `tool1`'s build parameters, which include `--cpu=x86`.

## Configuration conditions {:#configuration-conditions}

Each key in a configurable attribute is a label reference to a
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting) or
[`constraint_value`](/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#constraint_value).

`config_setting` is just a collection of
expected command line flag settings. By encapsulating these in a target, it's
easy to maintain "standard" conditions users can reference from multiple places.

`constraint_value` provides support for [multi-platform behavior](#platforms).

### Built-in flags {:#built-in-flags}

Flags like `--cpu` are built into Bazel: the build tool natively understands
them for all builds in all projects. These are specified with
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    values = {
        "flag1": "value1",
        "flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

`flagN` is a flag name (without `--`, so `"cpu"` instead of `"--cpu"`). `valueN`
is the expected value for that flag. `:meaningful_condition_name` matches if
*every* entry in `values` matches. Order is irrelevant.

`valueN` is parsed as if it was set on the command line. This means:

*  `values = { "compilation_mode": "opt" }` matches `bazel build -c opt`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "true" }` matches `bazel build --force_pic=1`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "0" }` matches `bazel build --noforce_pic`

`config_setting` only supports flags that affect target behavior. For example,
[`--show_progress`](/docs/user-manual#show-progress) isn't allowed because
it only affects how Bazel reports progress to the user. Targets can't use that
flag to construct their results. The exact set of supported flags isn't
documented. In practice, most flags that "make sense" work.

### Custom flags {:#custom-flags}

You can model your own project-specific flags with
[Starlark build settings][BuildSettings]. Unlike built-in flags, these are
defined as build targets, so Bazel references them with target labels.

These are triggered with [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`flag_values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.flag_values)
attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    flag_values = {
        "//myflags:flag1": "value1",
        "//myflags:flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

Behavior is the same as for [built-in flags](#built-in-flags). See [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/select_on_build_setting){: .external}
for a working example.

[`--define`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--define)
is an alternative legacy syntax for custom flags (for example
`--define foo=bar`). This can be expressed either in the
[values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute
(`values = {"define": "foo=bar"}`) or the
[define_values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.define_values) attribute
(`define_values = {"foo": "bar"}`). `--define` is only supported for backwards
compatibility. Prefer Starlark build settings whenever possible.

`values`, `flag_values`, and `define_values` evaluate independently. The
`config_setting` matches if all values across all of them match.

## The default condition {:#default-condition}

The built-in condition `//conditions:default` matches when no other condition
matches.

Because of the "exactly one match" rule, a configurable attribute with no match
and no default condition emits a `"no matching conditions"` error. This can
protect against silent failures from unexpected settings:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

cc_library(
    name = "x86_only_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":x86_cpu": ["lib.cc"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:x86_only_lib --cpu=arm
ERROR: Configurable attribute "srcs" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //myapp:x86_cpu
```

For even clearer errors, you can set custom messages with `select()`'s
[`no_match_error`](#custom-error-messages) attribute.

## Platforms {:#platforms}

While the ability to specify multiple flags on the command line provides
flexibility, it can also be burdensome to individually set each one every time
you want to build a target.
   [Platforms](/extending/platforms)
let you consolidate these into simple bundles.

```python
# myapp/BUILD

sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":basalt": ["pyroxene.sh"],
        ":marble": ["calcite.sh"],
        "//conditions:default": ["feldspar.sh"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "basalt",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

config_setting(
    name = "marble",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)

# constraint_setting acts as an enum type, and constraint_value as an enum value.
constraint_setting(name = "color")
constraint_value(name = "black", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_value(name = "white", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_setting(name = "texture")
constraint_value(name = "smooth", constraint_setting = "texture")
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")

platform(
    name = "basalt_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

platform(
    name = "marble_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":smooth",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)
```

The platform can be specified on the command line. It activates the
`config_setting`s that contain a subset of the platform's `constraint_values`,
allowing those `config_setting`s to match in `select()` expressions.

For example, in order to set the `srcs` attribute of `my_rocks` to `calcite.sh`,
you can simply run

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --platforms=//myapp:marble_platform
```

Without platforms, this might look something like

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --define color=white --define texture=smooth --define type=metamorphic
```

`select()` can also directly read `constraint_value`s:

```python
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")
sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":igneous": ["igneous.sh"],
        ":metamorphic" ["metamorphic.sh"],
    }),
)
```

This saves the need for boilerplate `config_setting`s when you only need to
check against single values.

Platforms are still under development. See the
[documentation](/concepts/platforms) for details.

## Combining `select()`s {:#combining-selects}

`select` can appear multiple times in the same attribute:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"] +
           select({
               ":armeabi_mode": ["armeabi_src.sh"],
               ":x86_mode": ["x86_src.sh"],
           }) +
           select({
               ":opt_mode": ["opt_extras.sh"],
               ":dbg_mode": ["dbg_extras.sh"],
           }),
)
```

Note: Some restrictions apply on what can be combined in the `select`s values:
 - Duplicate labels can appear in different paths of the same `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear within the same path of a `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear across multiple combined `select`s (no matter what path)

`select` cannot appear inside another `select`. If you need to nest `selects`
and your attribute takes other targets as values, use an intermediate target:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":armeabi_mode": [":armeabi_lib"],
        ...
    }),
)

sh_library(
    name = "armeabi_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":opt_mode": ["armeabi_with_opt.sh"],
        ...
    }),
)
```

If you need a `select` to match when multiple conditions match, consider [AND
chaining](#and-chaining).

## OR chaining {:#or-chaining}

Consider the following:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config2": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config3": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Most conditions evaluate to the same dep. But this syntax is hard to read and
maintain. It would be nice to not have to repeat `[":standard_lib"]` multiple
times.

One option is to predefine the value as a BUILD variable:

```python
STANDARD_DEP = [":standard_lib"]

sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config2": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config3": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

This makes it easier to manage the dependency. But it still causes unnecessary
duplication.

For more direct support, use one of the following:

### `selects.with_or` {:#selects-with-or}

The
[with_or](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectswith_or){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing conditions directly inside a `select`:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = selects.with_or({
        (":config1", ":config2", ":config3"): [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

### `selects.config_setting_group` {:#selects-config-setting-or-group}


The
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing multiple `config_setting`s:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```


```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_or_2",
    match_any = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_or_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike `selects.with_or`, different targets can share `:config1_or_2` across
different attributes.

It's an error for multiple conditions to match unless one is an unambiguous
"specialization" of the others or they all resolve to the same value. See [here](#configurable-build-example) for details.

## AND chaining {:#and-chaining}

If you need a `select` branch to match when multiple conditions match, use the
[Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external} macro
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_and_2",
    match_all = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_and_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike OR chaining, existing `config_setting`s can't be directly `AND`ed
inside a `select`. You have to explicitly wrap them in a `config_setting_group`.

## Custom error messages {:#custom-error-messages}

By default, when no condition matches, the target the `select()` is attached to
fails with the error:

```sh
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //tools/cc_target_os:darwin
  //tools/cc_target_os:android
```

This can be customized with the [`no_match_error`](/reference/be/functions#select)
attribute:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select(
        {
            "//tools/cc_target_os:android": [":android_deps"],
            "//tools/cc_target_os:windows": [":windows_deps"],
        },
        no_match_error = "Please build with an Android or Windows toolchain",
    ),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_lib
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration: Please
build with an Android or Windows toolchain
```

## Rules compatibility {:#rules-compatibility}

Rule implementations receive the *resolved values* of configurable
attributes. For example, given:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

some_rule(
    name = "my_target",
    some_attr = select({
        ":foo_mode": [":foo"],
        ":bar_mode": [":bar"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp/my_target --define mode=foo
```

Rule implementation code sees `ctx.attr.some_attr` as `[":foo"]`.

Macros can accept `select()` clauses and pass them through to native
rules. But *they cannot directly manipulate them*. For example, there's no way
for a macro to convert

```python
select({"foo": "val"}, ...)
```

to

```python
select({"foo": "val_with_suffix"}, ...)
```

This is for two reasons.

First, macros that need to know which path a `select` will choose *cannot work*
because macros are evaluated in Bazel's [loading phase](/run/build#loading),
which occurs before flag values are known.
This is a core Bazel design restriction that's unlikely to change any time soon.

Second, macros that just need to iterate over *all* `select` paths, while
technically feasible, lack a coherent UI. Further design is necessary to change
this.

## Bazel query and cquery {:#query-and-cquery}

Bazel [`query`](/query/guide) operates over Bazel's
[loading phase](/reference/glossary#loading-phase).
This means it doesn't know what command line flags a target uses since those
flags aren't evaluated until later in the build (in the
[analysis phase](/reference/glossary#analysis-phase)).
So it can't determine which `select()` branches are chosen.

Bazel [`cquery`](/query/cquery) operates after Bazel's analysis phase, so it has
all this information and can accurately resolve `select()`s.

Consider:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
```
```python
# myapp/BUILD

string_flag(
    name = "dog_type",
    build_setting_default = "cat"
)

cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select({
        ":long": [":foo_dep"],
        ":short": [":bar_dep"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "long",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "dachshund"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "short",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "pug"},
)
```

`query` overapproximates `:my_lib`'s dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel query 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)'
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:foo_dep
//myapp:bar_dep
```

while `cquery` shows its exact dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)' --//myapp:dog_type=pug
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:bar_dep
```

## FAQ {:#faq}

### Why doesn't select() work in macros? {:#faq-select-macro}

select() *does* work in rules! See [Rules compatibility](#rules-compatibility) for
details.

The key issue this question usually means is that select() doesn't work in
*macros*. These are different than *rules*. See the
documentation on [rules](/extending/rules) and [macros](/extending/macros)
to understand the difference.
Here's an end-to-end example:

Define a rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

# Rule implementation: when an attribute is read, all select()s have already
# been resolved. So it looks like a plain old attribute just like any other.
def _impl(ctx):
    name = ctx.attr.name
    allcaps = ctx.attr.my_config_string.upper()  # This works fine on all values.
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)

# Rule declaration:
my_custom_bazel_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {"my_config_string": attr.string()},
)

# Macro declaration:
def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    allcaps = my_config_string.upper()  # This line won't work with select(s).
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)
```

Instantiate the rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_rule")
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_macro")

my_custom_bazel_rule(
    name = "happy_rule",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "second string",
    }),
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "happy_macro",
    my_config_string = "fixed string",
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "sad_macro",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "other string",
    }),
)
```

Building fails because `sad_macro` can't process the `select()`:

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:all
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
ERROR: error loading package 'myapp': Package 'myapp' contains errors.
```

Building succeeds when you comment out `sad_macro`:

```sh
# Comment out sad_macro so it doesn't mess up the build.
$ bazel build //myapp:all
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:5:3: My name is happy_macro with custom message: FIXED STRING.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/hi.bzl:15:3: My name is happy_rule with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

This is impossible to change because *by definition* macros are evaluated before
Bazel reads the build's command line flags. That means there isn't enough
information to evaluate select()s.

Macros can, however, pass `select()`s as opaque blobs to rules:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    print("Invoking macro " + name)
    my_custom_bazel_rule(
        name = name + "_as_target",
        my_config_string = my_config_string,
    )
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:sad_macro_less_sad
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:23:3: Invoking macro sad_macro_less_sad.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:15:3: My name is sad_macro_less_sad with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

### Why does select() always return true? {:#faq-boolean-select}

Because *macros* (but not rules) by definition
[can't evaluate `select()`s](#faq-select-macro), any attempt to do so
usually produces an error:

```sh
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
```

Booleans are a special case that fail silently, so you should be particularly
vigilant with them:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def my_boolean_macro(boolval):
  print("TRUE" if boolval else "FALSE")

$ cat myapp/BUILD
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_boolean_macro")
my_boolean_macro(
    boolval = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": True,
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": False,
    }),
)

$ bazel build //myapp:all --cpu=x86
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
$ bazel build //mypro:all --cpu=ppc
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
```

This happens because macros don't understand the contents of `select()`.
So what they're really evaluting is the `select()` object itself. According to
[Pythonic](https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html) design
standards, all objects aside from a very small number of exceptions
automatically return true.

### Can I read select() like a dict? {:#faq-inspectable-select}

Macros [can't](#faq-select-macro) evaluate select(s) because macros evaluate before
Bazel knows what the build's command line parameters are. Can they at least read
the `select()`'s dictionary to, for example, add a suffix to each value?

Conceptually this is possible, but [it isn't yet a Bazel feature](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8419).
What you *can* do today is prepare a straight dictionary, then feed it into a
`select()`:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
  for key in select_cmd.keys():
    select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
  native.genrule(
      name = name,
      outs = [name + ".out"],
      srcs = [],
      cmd = "echo " + select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})
        + " > $@"
  )

$ cat myapp/BUILD
selecty_genrule(
    name = "selecty",
    select_cmd = {
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "x86 mode",
    },
)

$ bazel build //testapp:selecty --cpu=x86 && cat bazel-genfiles/testapp/selecty.out
x86 mode WITH SUFFIX
```

If you'd like to support both `select()` and native types, you can do this:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
    cmd_suffix = ""
    if type(select_cmd) == "string":
        cmd_suffix = select_cmd + " WITH SUFFIX"
    elif type(select_cmd) == "dict":
        for key in select_cmd.keys():
            select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
        cmd_suffix = select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})

    native.genrule(
        name = name,
        outs = [name + ".out"],
        srcs = [],
        cmd = "echo " + cmd_suffix + "> $@",
    )
```

### Why doesn't select() work with bind()? {:#faq-select-bind}

First of all, do not use `bind()`. It is deprecated in favor of `alias()`.

The technical answer is that [`bind()`](/reference/be/workspace#bind) is a repo
rule, not a BUILD rule.

Repo rules do not have a specific configuration, and aren't evaluated in
the same way as BUILD rules. Therefore, a `select()` in a `bind()` can't
actually evaluate to any specific branch.

Instead, you should use [`alias()`](/reference/be/general#alias), with a `select()` in
the `actual` attribute, to perform this type of run-time determination. This
works correctly, since `alias()` is a BUILD rule, and is evaluated with a
specific configuration.

You can even have a `bind()` target point to an `alias()`, if needed.

```sh
$ cat WORKSPACE
workspace(name = "myapp")
bind(name = "openssl", actual = "//:ssl")
http_archive(name = "alternative", ...)
http_archive(name = "boringssl", ...)

$ cat BUILD
config_setting(
    name = "alt_ssl",
    define_values = {
        "ssl_library": "alternative",
    },
)

alias(
    name = "ssl",
    actual = select({
        "//:alt_ssl": "@alternative//:ssl",
        "//conditions:default": "@boringssl//:ssl",
    }),
)
```

With this setup, you can pass `--define ssl_library=alternative`, and any target
that depends on either `//:ssl` or `//external:ssl` will see the alternative
located at `@alternative//:ssl`.

But really, stop using `bind()`.

### Why doesn't my select() choose what I expect? {:#faq-select-choose-condition}

If `//myapp:foo` has a `select()` that doesn't choose the condition you expect,
use [cquery](/query/cquery) and `bazel config` to debug:

If `//myapp:foo` is the top-level target you're building, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery //myapp:foo <desired build flags>
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

If you're building some other target `//bar` that depends on
//myapp:foo somewhere in its subgraph, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'somepath(//bar, //myapp:foo)' <desired build flags>
//bar:bar   (3ag3193fee94a2)
//bar:intermediate_dep (12e23b9a2b534a)
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

The `(12e23b9a2b534a)` next to `//myapp:foo` is a *hash* of the
configuration that resolves `//myapp:foo`'s `select()`. You can inspect its
values with `bazel config`:

```sh
$ bazel config 12e23b9a2b534a
BuildConfigurationValue 12e23b9a2b534a
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.CoreOptions {
  cpu: darwin
  compilation_mode: fastbuild
  ...
}
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.rules.cpp.CppOptions {
  linkopt: [-Dfoo=bar]
  ...
}
...
```

Then compare this output against the settings expected by each `config_setting`.

`//myapp:foo` may exist in different configurations in the same build. See the
[cquery docs](/query/cquery) for guidance on using `somepath` to get the right
one.

Caution: To prevent restarting the Bazel server, invoke `bazel config` with the
same command line flags as the `bazel cquery`. The `config` command relies on
the configuration nodes from the still-running server of the previous command.

### Why doesn't `select()` work with platforms? {:#faq-select-platforms}

Bazel doesn't support configurable attributes checking whether a given platform
is the target platform because the semantics are unclear.

For example:

```py
platform(
    name = "x86_linux_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

In this `BUILD` file, which `select()` should be used if the target platform has both the
`@platforms//cpu:x86` and `@platforms//os:linux` constraints, but is **not** the
`:x86_linux_platform` defined here? The author of the `BUILD` file and the user
who defined the separate platform may have different ideas.

#### What should I do instead?

Instead, define a `config_setting` that matches **any** platform with
these constraints:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_x86_linux",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_x86_linux": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

This process defines specific semantics, making it clearer to users what
platforms meet the desired conditions.

#### What if I really, really want to `select` on the platform?

If your build requirements specifically require checking the platform, you
can flip the value of the `--platforms` flag in a `config_setting`:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_specific_x86_linux_platform",
    values = {
        "platforms": ["//package:x86_linux_platform"],
    },
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_specific_x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

The Bazel team doesn't endorse doing this; it overly constrains your build and
confuses users when the expected condition does not match.

<p class="lead">Fast iterative development for Android</p>

This page describes how `bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development
for Android much faster. It describes the benefits of this approach versus the
challenges of the traditional app install method.

## Summary {:#summary}

To install small changes to an Android app very quickly, do the following:

 1. Find the `android_binary` rule of the app you want to install.
 2. Disable Proguard by removing the `proguard_specs` attribute.
 3. Set the `multidex` attribute to `native`.
 4. Set the `dex_shards` attribute to `10`.
 5. Connect your device running ART (not Dalvik) over USB and enable USB
    debugging on it.
 6. Run `bazel mobile-install :your_target`. App startup will be a little
    slower than usual.
 7. Edit the code or Android resources.
 8. Run `bazel mobile-install --incremental :your_target`.
 9. Enjoy not having to wait a lot.

Some command line options to Bazel that may be useful:

 - `--adb` tells Bazel which adb binary to use
 - `--adb_arg` can be used to  add extra arguments to the command line of `adb`.
   One useful application of this is to select which device you want to install
   to if you have multiple devices connected to your workstation:
   `bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=<SERIAL> :your_target`
 - `--start_app` automatically starts the app

When in doubt, look at the
[example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/examples/android){: .external}
or [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss){: .external}.

## Introduction {:#introduction}

One of the most important attributes of a developer's toolchain is speed: there
is a world of difference between changing the code and seeing it run within a
second and having to wait minutes, sometimes hours, before you get any feedback
on whether your changes do what you expect them to.

Unfortunately, the traditional Android toolchain for building an .apk entails
many monolithic, sequential steps and all of these have to be done in order to
build an Android app. At Google, waiting five minutes to build a single-line
change was not unusual on larger projects like Google Maps.

`bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development for Android much faster by
using a combination of change pruning, work sharding, and clever manipulation of
Android internals, all without changing any of your app's code.

## Problems with traditional app installation {:#problems-app-install}

Building an Android app has some issues, including:

- Dexing. By default, "dx" is invoked exactly once in the build and it does not
know how to reuse work from previous builds: it dexes every method again, even
though only one method was changed.

- Uploading data to the device. adb does not use the full bandwidth of a USB 2.0
connection, and larger apps can take a lot of time to upload. The entire app is
uploaded, even if only small parts have changed, for example, a resource or a
single method, so this can be a major bottleneck.

- Compilation to native code. Android L introduced ART, a new Android runtime,
which compiles apps ahead-of-time rather than compiling them just-in-time like
Dalvik. This makes apps much faster at the cost of longer installation
time. This is a good tradeoff for users because they typically install an app
once and use it many times, but results in slower development where an app is
installed many times and each version is run at most a handful of times.

## The approach of `bazel mobile-install` {:#approach-mobile-install}

`bazel mobile-install `makes the following improvements:

 - Sharded dexing. After building the app's Java code, Bazel shards the class
   files into approximately equal-sized parts and invokes `dx` separately on
   them. `dx` is not invoked on shards that did not change since the last build.

 - Incremental file transfer. Android resources, .dex files, and native
   libraries are removed from the main .apk and are stored in under a separate
   mobile-install directory. This makes it possible to update code and Android
   resources independently without reinstalling the whole app. Thus,
   transferring the files takes less time and only the .dex files that have
   changed are recompiled on-device.

 - Loading parts of the app from outside the .apk. A tiny stub application is
   put into the .apk that loads Android resources, Java code and native code
   from the on-device mobile-install directory, then transfers control to the
   actual app. This is all transparent to the app, except in a few corner cases
   described below.

### Sharded Dexing {:#sharded-dexing}

Sharded dexing is reasonably straightforward: once the .jar files are built, a
[tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/ziputils/DexMapper.java){: .external}
shards them into separate .jar files of approximately equal size, then invokes
`dx` on those that were changed since the previous build. The logic that
determines which shards to dex is not specific to Android: it just uses the
general change pruning algorithm of Bazel.

The first version of the sharding algorithm simply ordered the .class files
alphabetically, then cut the list up into equal-sized parts, but this proved to
be suboptimal: if a class was added or removed (even a nested or an anonymous
one), it would cause all the classes alphabetically after it to shift by one,
resulting in dexing those shards again. Thus, it was decided to shard Java
packages rather than individual classes. Of course, this still results in
dexing many shards if a new package is added or removed, but that is much less
frequent than adding or removing a single class.

The number of shards is controlled by the BUILD file (using the
`android_binary.dex_shards` attribute). In an ideal world, Bazel would
automatically determine how many shards are best, but Bazel currently must know
the set of actions (for example, commands to be executed during the build) before
executing any of them, so it cannot determine the optimal number of shards
because it doesn't know how many Java classes there will eventually be in the
app. Generally speaking, the more shards, the faster the build and the
installation will be, but the slower app startup becomes, because the dynamic
linker has to do more work. The sweet spot is usually between 10 and 50 shards.

### Incremental file transfer {:#incremental-file-transfer}

After building the app, the next step is to install it, preferably with the
least effort possible. Installation consists of the following steps:

 1. Installing the .apk (typically using `adb install`)
 2. Uploading the .dex files, Android resources, and native libraries to the
    mobile-install directory

There is not much incrementality in the first step: the app is either installed
or not. Bazel currently relies on the user to indicate if it should do this step
through the `--incremental` command line option because it cannot determine in
all cases if it is necessary.

In the second step, the app's files from the build are compared to an on-device
manifest file that lists which app files are on the device and their
checksums. Any new files are uploaded to the device, any files that have changed
are updated, and any files that have been removed are deleted from the
device. If the manifest is not present, it is assumed that every file needs to
be uploaded.

Note that it is possible to fool the incremental installation algorithm by
changing a file on the device, but not its checksum in the manifest. This could
have been safeguarded against by computing the checksum of the files on the
device, but this was deemed to be not worth the increase in installation time.

### The Stub application {:#stub-app}

The stub application is where the magic to load the dexes, native code and
Android resources from the on-device `mobile-install` directory happens.

The actual loading is implemented by subclassing `BaseDexClassLoader` and is a
reasonably well-documented technique. This happens before any of the app's
classes are loaded, so that any application classes that are in the apk can be
placed in the on-device `mobile-install` directory so that they can be updated
without `adb install`.

This needs to happen before any of the
classes of the app are loaded, so that no application class needs to be in the
.apk which would mean that changes to those classes would require a full
re-install.

This is accomplished by replacing the `Application` class specified in
`AndroidManifest.xml` with the
[stub application](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/incrementaldeployment/StubApplication.java){: .external}. This
takes control when the app is started, and tweaks the class loader and the
resource manager appropriately at the earliest moment (its constructor) using
Java reflection on the internals of the Android framework.

Another thing the stub application does is to copy the native libraries
installed by mobile-install to another location. This is necessary because the
dynamic linker needs the `X` bit to be set on the files, which is not possible to
do for any location accessible by a non-root `adb`.

Once all these things are done, the stub application then instantiates the
actual `Application` class, changing all references to itself to the actual
application within the Android framework.

## Results {:#results}

### Performance {:#performance}

In general, `bazel mobile-install` results in a 4x to 10x speedup of building
and installing large apps after a small change.

The following numbers were computed for a few Google products:

<img src="/docs/images/mobile-install-performance.svg"/>

This, of course, depends on the nature of the change: recompilation after
changing a base library takes more time.

### Limitations {:#limitations}

The tricks the stub application plays don't work in every case.
The following cases highlight where it does not work as expected:

 - When `Context` is cast to the `Application` class in
   `ContentProvider#onCreate()`. This method is called during application
   startup before we have a chance to replace the instance of the `Application`
   class, therefore, `ContentProvider` will still reference the stub application
   instead of the real one. Arguably, this is not a bug since you are not
   supposed to downcast `Context` like this, but this seems to happen in a few
   apps at Google.

 - Resources installed by `bazel mobile-install` are only available from within
   the app. If resources are accessed by other apps via
   `PackageManager#getApplicationResources()`, these resources will be from the
   last non-incremental install.

 - Devices that aren't running ART. While the stub application works well on
   Froyo and later, Dalvik has a bug that makes it think that the app is
   incorrect if its code is distributed over multiple .dex files in certain
   cases, for example, when Java annotations are used in a
   [specific](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78144){: .external}
   way. As long as your app doesn't tickle these bugs, it should work with Dalvik,
   too (note, however, that support for old Android versions isn't exactly our
   focus)

# Using the Android Native Development Kit with Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, please start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

## Overview {:#overview}

Bazel can run in many different build configurations, including several that use
the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) toolchain. This means that normal
`cc_library` and `cc_binary` rules can be compiled for Android directly within
Bazel. Bazel accomplishes this by using the `android_ndk_repository` repository
rule.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Please ensure that you have installed the Android SDK and NDK.

To set up the SDK and NDK, add the following snippet to your `WORKSPACE`:

```python
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidsdk".
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.
)

android_ndk_repository(
    name = "androidndk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidndk".
    path = "/path/to/ndk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable is set.
)
```

For more information about the `android_ndk_repository` rule, see the [Build
Encyclopedia entry](/reference/be/android#android_ndk_repository).

If you're using a recent version of the Android NDK (r22 and beyond), use the
Starlark implementation of `android_ndk_repository`.
Follow the instructions in
[its README](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk).

## Quick start {:#quick-start}

To build C++ for Android, simply add `cc_library` dependencies to your
`android_binary` or `android_library` rules.

For example, given the following `BUILD` file for an Android app:

```python
# In <project>/app/src/main/BUILD.bazel

cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
)

android_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["java/com/example/android/bazel/MainActivity.java"],
    resource_files = glob(["res/**/*"]),
    custom_package = "com.example.android.bazel",
    manifest = "LibraryManifest.xml",
    deps = [":jni_lib"],
)

android_binary(
    name = "app",
    deps = [":lib"],
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
)
```

This `BUILD` file results in the following target graph:

![Example results](/docs/images/android_ndk.png "Build graph results")

**Figure 1.** Build graph of Android project with cc_library dependencies.

To build the app, simply run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //app/src/main:app
```

The `bazel build` command compiles the Java files, Android resource files, and
`cc_library` rules, and packages everything into an APK:

```posix-terminal
$ zipinfo -1 bazel-bin/app/src/main/app.apk
nativedeps
lib/armeabi-v7a/libapp.so
classes.dex
AndroidManifest.xml
...
res/...
...
META-INF/CERT.SF
META-INF/CERT.RSA
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

Bazel compiles all of the cc_libraries into a single shared object (`.so`) file,
targeted for the `armeabi-v7a` ABI by default. To change this or build for
multiple ABIs at the same time, see the section on [configuring the target
ABI](#configuring-target-abi).

## Example setup {:#example-setup}

This example is available in the [Bazel examples
repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/master/android/ndk){: .external}.

In the `BUILD.bazel` file, three targets are defined with the `android_binary`,
`android_library`, and `cc_library` rules.

The `android_binary` top-level target builds the APK.

The `cc_library` target contains a single C++ source file with a JNI function
implementation:

```c++
#include <jni.h>
#include <string>

extern "C"
JNIEXPORT jstring

JNICALL
Java_com_example_android_bazel_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv *env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    std::string hello = "Hello from C++";
    return env->NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
}
```

The `android_library` target specifies the Java sources, resource files, and the
dependency on a `cc_library` target. For this example, `MainActivity.java` loads
the shared object file `libapp.so`, and defines the method signature for the JNI
function:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("app");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       // ...
    }

    public native String stringFromJNI();

}
```

Note: The name of the native library is derived from the name of the top
level `android_binary` target. In this example, it is `app`.

## Configuring the target ABI {:#configuring-target-abi}

To configure the target ABI, use the `--android_platforms` flag as follows:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}comma-separated list of platforms{{ "</var>" }}
```

Just like the `--platforms` flag, the values passed to `--android_platforms` are
the labels of [`platform`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#platform)
targets, using standard constraint values to describe your device.

For example, for an Android device with a 64-bit ARM processor, you'd define
your platform like this:

```py
platform(
    name = "android_arm64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:android",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm64",
    ],
)
```

Every Android `platform` should use the [`@platforms//os:android`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms/blob/33a3b209f94856193266871b1545054afb90bb28/os/BUILD#L36)
OS constraint. To migrate the CPU constraint, check this chart:

CPU Value     | Platform
------------- | ------------------------------------------
`armeabi-v7a` | `@platforms//cpu:armv7`
`arm64-v8a`   | `@platforms//cpu:arm64`
`x86`         | `@platforms//cpu:x86_32`
`x86_64`      | `@platforms//cpu:x86_64`

And, of course, for a multi-architecture APK, you pass multiple labels, for
example: `--android_platforms=//:arm64,//:x86_64` (assuming you defined those in
your top-level `BUILD.bazel` file).

Bazel is unable to select a default Android platform, so one must be defined and
specified with `--android_platforms`.

Depending on the NDK revision and Android API level, the following ABIs are
available:

| NDK revision | ABIs                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 16 and lower | armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, mips64, x86, x86\_64 |
| 17 and above | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86\_64                        |

See [the NDK docs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html){: .external}
for more information on these ABIs.

Multi-ABI Fat APKs are not recommended for release builds since they increase
the size of the APK, but can be useful for development and QA builds.

## Selecting a C++ standard {:#selecting-c-standard}

Use the following flags to build according to a C++ standard:

| C++ Standard | Flag                    |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| C++98        | Default, no flag needed |
| C++11        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++11`   |
| C++14        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++14`   |
| C++17        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++17`   |

For example:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --cxxopt=-std=c++11
```

Read more about passing compiler and linker flags with `--cxxopt`, `--copt`, and
`--linkopt` in the [User Manual](/docs/user-manual#cxxopt).

Compiler and linker flags can also be specified as attributes in `cc_library`
using `copts` and `linkopts`. For example:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
    copts = ["-std=c++11"],
    linkopts = ["-ldl"], # link against libdl
)
```

## Building a `cc_library` for Android without using `android_binary` {:#cclibrary-android}

To build a standalone `cc_binary` or `cc_library` for Android without using an
`android_binary`, use the `--platforms` flag.

For example, assuming you have defined Android platforms in
`my/platforms/BUILD`:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target \
      --platforms=//my/platforms:x86_64
```

With this approach, the entire build tree is affected.

Note: All of the targets on the command line must be compatible with
building for Android when specifying these flags, which may make it difficult to
use [Bazel wild-cards](/run/build#specifying-build-targets) like
`/...` and `:all`.

These flags can be put into a `bazelrc` config (one for each ABI), in
`{{ "<var>" }}project{{ "</var>" }}/.bazelrc`:

```
common:android_x86 --platforms=//my/platforms:x86

common:android_armeabi-v7a --platforms=//my/platforms:armeabi-v7a

# In general
common:android_<abi> --platforms=//my/platforms:<abi>
```

Then, to build a `cc_library` for `x86` for example, run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target --config=android_x86
```

In general, use this method for low-level targets (like `cc_library`) or when
you know exactly what you're building; rely on the automatic configuration
transitions from `android_binary` for high-level targets where you're expecting
to build a lot of targets you don't control.

# C++ Toolchain Configuration

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

## Overview {:#overview}

To invoke the compiler with the right options, Bazel needs some knowledge about
the compiler internals, such as include directories and important flags.
In other words, Bazel needs a simplified model of the compiler to understand its
workings.

Bazel needs to know the following:

* Whether the compiler supports thinLTO, modules, dynamic linking, or PIC
  (position independent code).
* Paths to the required tools such as gcc, ld, ar, objcopy, and so on.
* The built-in system include directories. Bazel needs these to validate that
  all headers that were included in the source file were properly declared in
  the `BUILD` file.
* The default sysroot.
* Which flags to use for compilation, linking, archiving.
* Which flags to use for the supported compilation modes (opt, dbg, fastbuild).
* Make variables specifically required by the compiler.

If the compiler has support for multiple architectures, Bazel needs to configure
them separately.

[`CcToolchainConfigInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/CcToolchainConfigInfo) is a provider that provides the necessary level of
granularity for configuring the behavior of Bazel's C++ rules. By default,
Bazel automatically configures `CcToolchainConfigInfo` for your build, but you
have the option to configure it manually. For that, you need a Starlark rule
that provides the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` and you need to point the
[`toolchain_config`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain.toolchain_config) attribute of the
[`cc_toolchain`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain) to your rule.
You can create the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` by calling
[`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info()`](/rules/lib/toplevel/cc_common#create_cc_toolchain_config_info).
You can find Starlark constructors for all structs you'll need in the process in
[`@rules_cc//cc:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/blob/master/cc/cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl){: .external}.


When a C++ target enters the analysis phase, Bazel selects the appropriate
`cc_toolchain` target based on the `BUILD` file, and obtains the
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider from the target specified in the
`cc_toolchain.toolchain_config` attribute. The `cc_toolchain` target
passes this information to the C++ target through a `CcToolchainProvider`.

For example, a compile or link action, instantiated by a rule such as
`cc_binary` or `cc_library`, needs the following information:

*   The compiler or linker to use
*   Command-line flags for the compiler/linker
*   Configuration flags passed through the `--copt/--linkopt` options
*   Environment variables
*   Artifacts needed in the sandbox in which the action executes

All of the above information except the artifacts required in the sandbox is
specified in the Starlark target that the `cc_toolchain` points to.

The artifacts to be shipped to the sandbox are declared in the `cc_toolchain`
target. For example, with the `cc_toolchain.linker_files` attribute you can
specify the linker binary and toolchain libraries to ship into the sandbox.

## Toolchain selection {:#toolchain-selection}

The toolchain selection logic operates as follows:

1.  User specifies a `cc_toolchain_suite` target in the `BUILD` file and points
    Bazel to the target using the
    [`--crosstool_top` option](/docs/user-manual#flag--crosstool_top).

2.  The `cc_toolchain_suite` target references multiple toolchains. The
    values of the `--cpu` and `--compiler` flags determine which of those
    toolchains is selected, either based only on the `--cpu` flag value, or
    based on a joint `--cpu | --compiler` value. The selection process is as
    follows:

  * If the `--compiler` option is specified, Bazel selects the
        corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
        attribute with `--cpu | --compiler`. If Bazel does not find
        a corresponding entry, it throws an error.

  * If the `--compiler` option is not specified, Bazel selects
    the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
    attribute with just `--cpu`.

  * If no flags are specified, Bazel inspects the host system and selects a
    `--cpu` value based on its findings. See the
    [inspection mechanism code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/1b73bc37e184e71651eb631223dcce321ba16211:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/AutoCpuConverter.java).

Once a toolchain has been selected, corresponding `feature` and `action_config`
objects in the Starlark rule govern the configuration of the build (that is,
items described later). These messages allow the implementation of
fully fledged C++ features in Bazel without modifying the
Bazel binary. C++ rules support multiple unique actions documented in detail
[in the Bazel source code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/4f547a7ea86df80e4c76145ffdbb0c8b75ba3afa:tools/build_defs/cc/action_names.bzl).

## Features {:#features}

A feature is an entity that requires command-line flags, actions,
constraints on the execution environment, or dependency alterations. A feature
can be something as simple as allowing `BUILD` files to select configurations of
flags, such as `treat_warnings_as_errors`, or interact with the C++ rules and
include new compile actions and inputs to the compilation, such as
`header_modules` or `thin_lto`.

Ideally, `CcToolchainConfigInfo` contains a list of features, where each
feature consists of one or more flag groups, each defining a list of flags
that apply to specific Bazel actions.

A feature is specified by name, which allows full decoupling of the Starlark
rule configuration from Bazel releases. In other words, a Bazel release does not
affect the behavior of `CcToolchainConfigInfo` configurations as long as those
configurations do not require the use of new features.

A feature is enabled in one of the following ways:

*  The feature's `enabled` field is set to `true`.
*  Bazel or the rule owner explicitly enable it.
*  The user enables it through the `--feature` Bazel option or `features` rule
   attribute.

Features can have interdependencies, depend on command line flags, `BUILD` file
settings, and other variables.

### Feature relationships {:#feature-relationships}

Dependencies are typically managed directly with Bazel, which simply enforces
the requirements and manages conflicts intrinsic to the nature of the features
defined in the build. The toolchain specification allows for more granular
constraints for use directly within the Starlark rule that govern feature
support and expansion. These are:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Constraint</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>requires = [
   feature_set (features = [
       'feature-name-1',
       'feature-name-2'
   ]),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Feature-level. The feature is supported only if the specified required
       features are enabled. For example, when a feature is only supported in
       certain build modes (<code>opt</code>, <code>dbg</code>, or
       <code>fastbuild</code>). If `requires` contains multiple `feature_set`s
       the feature is supported if any of the `feature_set`s is satisfied
       (when all specified features are enabled).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>implies = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. This feature implies the specified feature(s).
       Enabling a feature also implicitly enables all features implied by it
       (that is, it functions recursively).</p>
       <p>Also provides the ability to factor common subsets of functionality out of
       a set of features, such as the common parts of sanitizers. Implied
       features cannot be disabled.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>provides = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. Indicates that this feature is one of several mutually
       exclusive alternate features. For example, all of the sanitizers could
       specify <code>provides = ["sanitizer"]</code>.</p>
       <p>This improves error handling by listing the alternatives if the user asks
       for two or more mutually exclusive features at once.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>with_features = [
  with_feature_set(
    features = ['feature-1'],
    not_features = ['feature-2'],
  ),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Flag set-level. A feature can specify multiple flag sets with multiple.
     When <code>with_features</code> is specified, the flag set will only expand
     to the build command if there is at least one <code>with_feature_set</code>
     for which all of the features in the specified <code>features</code> set
     are enabled, and all the features specified in <code>not_features</code>
     set are disabled.
     If <code>with_features</code> is not specified, the flag set will be
     applied unconditionally for every action specified.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Actions {:#actions}

Actions provide the flexibility to modify the circumstances under
which an action executes without assuming how the action will be run. An
`action_config` specifies the tool binary that an action invokes, while a
`feature` specifies the configuration (flags) that determine how that tool
behaves when the action is invoked.

[Features](#features) reference actions to signal which Bazel actions
they affect since actions can modify the Bazel action graph. The
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider contains actions that have flags and tools
associated with them, such as `c++-compile`. Flags are assigned to each action
by associating them with a feature.

Each action name represents a single type of action performed by Bazel, such as
compiling or linking. There is, however, a many-to-one relationship between
actions and Bazel action types, where a Bazel action type refers to a Java class
that implements an action (such as `CppCompileAction`). In particular, the
"assembler actions" and "compiler actions" in the table below are
`CppCompileAction`, while the link actions are `CppLinkAction`.

### Assembler actions {:#assembler-actions}

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Action</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>

   </td>
   <td>Assemble with preprocessing. Typically for <code>.S</code> files.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>assemble</code>
   </td>
   <td>Assemble without preprocessing. Typically for <code>.s</code> files.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Compiler actions {:#compiler-actions}

## Using action_config {:#using-action-config}

The `action_config` is a Starlark struct that describes a Bazel
action by specifying the tool (binary) to invoke during the action and sets of
flags, defined by features. These flags apply constraints to the action's
execution.

The `action_config()` constructor has the following parameters:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Attribute</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>action_name</code>
   </td>
    <td>The Bazel action to which this action corresponds.
        Bazel uses this attribute to discover per-action tool and execution
        requirements.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>tools</code>
   </td>
   <td>The executable to invoke. The tool applied to the action will be the
       first tool in the list with a feature set that matches the feature
       configuration. Default value must be provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>flag_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of flags that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a
       feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>env_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of environment constraints that applies to a group of actions.
       Same as for a feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

An `action_config` can require and imply other features and
<code>action_config</code>s as dictated by the
[feature relationships](#feature-relationships) described earlier. This behavior
is similar to that of a feature.

The last two attributes are redundant against the corresponding attributes on
features and are included because some Bazel actions require certain flags or
environment variables and the goal is to avoid unnecessary `action_config`+`feature`
pairs. Typically, sharing a single feature across multiple `action_config`s is
preferred.

You can not define more than one `action_config` with the same `action_name`
within the same toolchain. This prevents ambiguity in tool paths
and enforces the intention behind `action_config` - that an action's properties
are clearly described in a single place in the toolchain.

### Using tool constructor {:#using-tool-constructor}

An`action_config` can specify a set of tools via its `tools` parameter.
The `tool()` constructor takes in the following parameters:


<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>path</code>
   </td>
   <td>Path to the tool in question (relative to the current location).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>with_features</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of feature sets out of which at least one must be satisfied
       for this tool to apply.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For a given `action_config`, only a single `tool` applies
its tool path and execution requirements to the Bazel action. A tool is selected
by iterating through the `tools` attribute on an `action_config` until a tool
with a `with_feature` set matching the feature configuration is found
(see [Feature relationships](#feature-relationships) earlier on this page
for more information). You should end your tool lists with a default
tool that corresponds to an empty feature configuration.

### Example usage {:#example-usage}

Features and actions can be used together to implement Bazel actions
with diverse cross-platform semantics. For example, debug symbol generation on
macOS requires generating symbols in the compile action, then invoking a
specialized tool during the link action to create  compressed dsym archive, and
then decompressing that archive to produce the application bundle and `.plist`
files consumable by Xcode.

With Bazel, this process can instead be implemented as follows, with
`unbundle-debuginfo` being a Bazel action:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            action_name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    with_features = [
                        with_feature(features=["generate-debug-symbols"]),
                    ],
                    path = "toolchain/mac/ld-with-dsym-packaging",
                ),
                tool (path = "toolchain/mac/ld"),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature(
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set (
                    actions = [
                        ACTION_NAMES.c_compile,
                        ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile
                    ],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-g"],
                        ),
                    ],
                )
            ],
            implies = ["unbundle-debuginfo"],
       ),
    ]


This same feature can be implemented entirely differently for Linux, which uses
`fission`, or for Windows, which produces `.pdb` files. For example, the
implementation for `fission`-based debug symbol generation might look as
follows:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    path = "toolchain/bin/gcc",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature (
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            requires = [with_feature_set(features = ["dbg"])],
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-gsplit-dwarf"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-Wl", "--gdb-index"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
          ],
        ),
    ]


### Flag groups {:#flag-groups}

`CcToolchainConfigInfo` allows you to bundle flags into groups that serve a
specific purpose. You can specify a flag within using pre-defined variables
within the flag value, which the compiler expands when adding the flag to the
build command. For example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["%{output_execpath}"],
    )


In this case, the contents of the flag will be replaced by the output file path
of the action.

Flag groups are expanded to the build command in the order in which they appear
in the list, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

For flags that need to repeat with different values when added to the build
command, the flag group can iterate variables of type `list`. For example, the
variable `include_path` of type `list`:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I<path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list. All
flags (or `flag_group`s) in the body of a flag group declaration are expanded as
a unit. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I", "%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I <path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list.

A variable can repeat multiple times. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-iprefix=%{include_paths}", "-isystem=%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to:

    -iprefix=<inc0> -isystem=<inc0> -iprefix=<inc1> -isystem=<inc1>

Variables can correspond to structures accessible using dot-notation. For
example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.name}"],
    )

Structures can be nested and may also contain sequences. To prevent name clashes
and to be explicit, you must specify the full path through the fields. For
example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
            ),
        ],
    )


### Conditional expansion {:#conditional-expansion}

Flag groups support conditional expansion based on the presence of a particular
variable or its field using the `expand_if_available`, `expand_if_not_available`,
`expand_if_true`, `expand_if_false`, or `expand_if_equal` attributes. For example:


    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--whole_archive"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--no_whole_archive"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
        ],
    )

Note: The `--whole_archive` and `--no_whole_archive` options are added to
the build command only when a currently iterated library has an
`is_whole_archive` field.

    <li>Adds <code>compiler_output_flags</code> (if not present) feature to the bottom of the toolchain</li>
  </ul>
</p>

This is a long list of features. The plan is to get rid of them once
[Crosstool in Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380){: .external} is
done. For the curious reader see the implementation in
[CppActionConfigs](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CppActionConfigs.java?q=cppactionconfigs&ss=bazel),
and for production toolchains consider adding `no_legacy_features` to make
the toolchain more standalone.

# Android Build Performance

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains information on optimizing build performance for Android
apps specifically. For general build performance optimization with Bazel, see
[Optimizing Performance](/rules/performance).

## Recommended flags {:#recommended-flags}

The flags are in the
[`bazelrc` configuration syntax](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-syntax-semantics), so
they can be pasted directly into a `bazelrc` file and invoked with
`--config=<configuration_name>` on the command line.

**Profiling performance**

Bazel writes a JSON trace profile by default to a file called
`command.profile.gz` in Bazel's output base.
See the [JSON Profile documentation](/rules/performance#performance-profiling) for
how to read and interact with the profile.

**Persistent workers for Android build actions**.

A subset of Android build actions has support for
[persistent workers](https://blog.bazel.build/2015/12/10/java-workers.html).

These actions' mnemonics are:

*   DexBuilder
*   Javac
*   Desugar
*   AaptPackage
*   AndroidResourceParser
*   AndroidResourceValidator
*   AndroidResourceCompiler
*   RClassGenerator
*   AndroidResourceLink
*   AndroidAapt2
*   AndroidAssetMerger
*   AndroidResourceMerger
*   AndroidCompiledResourceMerger

Enabling workers can result in better build performance by saving on JVM
startup costs from invoking each of these tools, but at the cost of increased
memory usage on the system by persisting them.

To enable workers for these actions, apply these flags with
`--config=android_workers` on the command line:

```
build:android_workers --strategy=DexBuilder=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Javac=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Desugar=worker

# A wrapper flag for these resource processing actions:
# - AndroidResourceParser
# - AndroidResourceValidator
# - AndroidResourceCompiler
# - RClassGenerator
# - AndroidResourceLink
# - AndroidAapt2
# - AndroidAssetMerger
# - AndroidResourceMerger
# - AndroidCompiledResourceMerger
build:android_workers --persistent_android_resource_processor
```

The default number of persistent workers created per action is `4`. We have
[measured improved build performance](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8586#issuecomment-500070549){: .external}
by capping the number of instances for each action to `1` or `2`, although this
may vary depending on the system Bazel is running on, and the project being
built.

To cap the number of instances for an action, apply these flags:

```
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=DexBuilder=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Javac=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Desugar=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=AaptPackage=2
# .. and so on for each action you're interested in.
```

**Using AAPT2**

[`aapt2`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2){: .external} has improved
performance over `aapt` and also creates smaller APKs. To use `aapt2`, use the
`--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or set `aapt2` on the `aapt_version` on
`android_binary` and `android_local_test`.

**SSD optimizations**

The `--experimental_multi_threaded_digest` flag is useful for optimizing digest
computation on SSDs.

# Commands and Options

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page covers the options that are available with various Bazel commands,
such as `bazel build`, `bazel run`, and `bazel test`. This page is a companion
to the list of Bazel's commands in [Build with Bazel](/run/build).

## Target syntax {:#target-syntax}

Some commands, like `build` or `test`, can operate on a list of targets. They
use a syntax more flexible than labels, which is documented in
[Specifying targets to build](/run/build#specifying-build-targets).

## Options {:#build-options}

The following sections describe the options available during a
build. When `--long` is used on a help command, the on-line
help messages provide summary information about the meaning, type and
default value for each option.

Most options can only be specified once. When specified multiple times, the
last instance wins. Options that can be specified multiple times are
identified in the on-line help with the text 'may be used multiple times'.

### Package location {:#package-location}

#### `--package_path` {:#package-path}

**WARNING:** The `--package_path` option is deprecated. Bazel prefers packages
in the main repository to be under the workspace root.

This option specifies the set of directories that are searched to
find the BUILD file for a given package.

Bazel finds its packages by searching the package path. This is a colon
separated ordered list of bazel directories, each being the root of a
partial source tree.

_To specify a custom package path_ using the `--package_path` option:

<pre>
  % bazel build --package_path %workspace%:/some/other/root
</pre>

Package path elements may be specified in three formats:

1.  If the first character is `/`, the path is absolute.
2.  If the path starts with `%workspace%`, the path is taken relative
    to the nearest enclosing bazel directory.
    For instance, if your working directory
    is `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, then the
    string `%workspace%` in the package-path is expanded
    to `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel`.
3.  Anything else is taken relative to the working directory.
    This is usually not what you mean to do,
    and may behave unexpectedly if you use Bazel from directories below the bazel workspace.
    For instance, if you use the package-path element `.`,
    and then cd into the directory
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, packages
    will be resolved from the
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo` directory.

If you use a non-default package path, specify it in your
[Bazel configuration file](/run/bazelrc) for convenience.

_Bazel doesn't require any packages to be in the
current directory_, so you can do a build from an empty bazel
workspace if all the necessary packages can be found somewhere else
on the package path.

Example: Building from an empty client

<pre>
  % mkdir -p foo/bazel
  % cd foo/bazel
  % touch MODULE.bazel
  % bazel build --package_path /some/other/path //foo
</pre>

#### `--deleted_packages` {:flag--deleted_packages}

This option specifies a comma-separated list of packages which Bazel
should consider deleted, and not attempt to load from any directory
on the package path. This can be used to simulate the deletion of packages without
actually deleting them. This option can be passed multiple times, in which case
the individual lists are concatenated.

### Error checking {:#error-checking}

These options control Bazel's error-checking and/or warnings.

#### `--[no]check_visibility` {:#check-visibility}

If this option is set to false, visibility checks are demoted to warnings.
The default value of this option is true, so that by default, visibility
checking is done.

#### `--output_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-filter}

The `--output_filter` option will only show build and compilation
warnings for targets that match the regular expression. If a target does not
match the given regular expression and its execution succeeds, its standard
output and standard error are thrown away.

Here are some typical values for this option:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//(first/project|second/project):'`</td>
    <td>Show the output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//((?!(first/bad_project|second/bad_project):).)*$'`</td>
    <td>Don't show output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=`</td>
    <td>Show everything.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=DONT_MATCH_ANYTHING`</td>
    <td>Show nothing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tool flags {:#tool-flags}

These options control which options Bazel will pass to other tools.

#### `--copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler.
The argument will be passed to the compiler whenever it is invoked
for preprocessing, compiling, and/or assembling C, C++, or
assembler code. It will not be passed when linking.

This option can be used multiple times. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-g0" --copt="-fpic" //foo
</pre>

will compile the `foo` library without debug tables, generating
position-independent code.

Note: Changing `--copt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected object files. Also note that copts values listed in specific
cc_library or cc_binary build rules will be placed on the compiler command line
_after_ these options.

Warning: C++-specific options (such as `-fno-implicit-templates`)
should be specified in `--cxxopt`, not in
`--copt`. Likewise, C-specific options (such as -Wstrict-prototypes)
should be specified in `--conlyopt`, not in `copt`.
Similarly, compiler options that only have an
effect at link time (such as `-l`) should be specified in
`--linkopt`, not in `--copt`.

#### `--host_copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--copt`](#copt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-conlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--conlyopt`](#cconlyopt) option, but applies only
to the exec configuration.

#### `--host_cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C++ source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--cxxopt`](#cxxopt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the linker for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--linkopt`](#linkopt) option, but applies only to
the exec configuration.

#### `--conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cconlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when compiling C source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C compilation,
not to C++ compilation or linking. So you can pass C-specific options
(such as `-Wno-pointer-sign`) using `--conlyopt`.

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when
compiling C++ source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C++ compilation,
not to C compilation or linking. So you can pass C++-specific options
(such as `-fpermissive` or `-fno-implicit-templates`) using `--cxxopt`.

For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --cxxopt="-fpermissive" --cxxopt="-Wno-error" //foo/cruddy_code
</pre>

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when linking.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to linking,
not to compilation. So you can pass compiler options that only make sense
at link time (such as `-lssp` or `-Wl,--wrap,abort`)
using `--linkopt`. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-fmudflap" --linkopt="-lmudflap" //foo/buggy_code
</pre>

Build rules can also specify link options in their attributes. This option's
settings always take precedence. Also see
[cc_library.linkopts](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.linkopts).

#### `--strip (always|never|sometimes)` {:#strip}

This option determines whether Bazel will strip debugging information from
all binaries and shared libraries, by invoking the linker with the `-Wl,--strip-debug` option.
`--strip=always` means always strip debugging information.
`--strip=never` means never strip debugging information.
The default value of `--strip=sometimes` means strip if the `--compilation_mode`
is `fastbuild`.

<pre>
  % bazel build --strip=always //foo:bar
</pre>

will compile the target while stripping debugging information from all generated
binaries.

Note: If you want debugging information, it's not enough to disable stripping;
you also need to make sure that the debugging information was generated by the
compiler, which you can do by using either `-c dbg` or `--copt -g`.

Bazel's `--strip` option corresponds with ld's `--strip-debug` option:
it only strips debugging information. If for some reason you want to strip _all_ symbols,
not just _debug_ symbols, you would need to use ld's `--strip-all` option,
which you can do by passing `--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all` to Bazel. Also be
aware that setting Bazel's `--strip` flag will override
`--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all`, so you should only set one or the other.

If you are only building a single binary and want all symbols stripped, you could also
pass `--stripopt=--strip-all` and explicitly build the
`//foo:bar.stripped` version of the target. As described in the section on
`--stripopt`, this applies a strip action after the final binary is
linked rather than including stripping in all of the build's link actions.

#### `--stripopt={{ "<var>" }}strip-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#stripopt}

This is an additional option to pass to the `strip` command when generating
a [`*.stripped` binary](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary_implicit_outputs). The default
is `-S -p`. This option can be used multiple times.

Note: `--stripopt` does not apply to the stripping of the main
binary with `[--strip](#flag--strip)=(always|sometimes)`.

#### `--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}profile-output-dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-instrument}

The `--fdo_instrument` option enables the generation of
FDO (feedback directed optimization) profile output when the
built C/C++ binary is executed. For GCC, the argument provided is used as a
directory prefix for a per-object file directory tree of .gcda files
containing profile information for each .o file.

Once the profile data tree has been generated, the profile tree
should be zipped up, and provided to the
`--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}`
Bazel option to enable the FDO-optimized compilation.

For the LLVM compiler the argument is also the directory under which the raw LLVM profile
data file(s) is dumped. For example:
`--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}/path/to/rawprof/dir/{{ "</var>" }}`.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-optimize}

The `--fdo_optimize` option enables the use of the
per-object file profile information to perform FDO (feedback
directed optimization) optimizations when compiling. For GCC, the argument
provided is the zip file containing the previously-generated file tree
of .gcda files containing profile information for each .o file.

Alternatively, the argument provided can point to an auto profile
identified by the extension .afdo.

Note: This option also accepts labels that resolve to source files. You
may need to add an `exports_files` directive to the corresponding package to
make the file visible to Bazel.

For the LLVM compiler the argument provided should point to the indexed LLVM
profile output file prepared by the llvm-profdata tool, and should have a .profdata
extension.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-language-version}

This option specifies the version of Java sources. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --java_language_version=8 java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

compiles and allows only constructs compatible with Java 8 specification.
Default value is 11. -->
Possible values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 21 and may be extended by
registering custom Java toolchains using `default_java_toolchain`.

#### `--tool_java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-language-version}

The Java language version used to build tools that are executed during a build.
Default value is 11.

#### `--java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-runtime-version}

This option specifies the version of JVM to use to execute the code and run the tests. For
example:

<pre>
  % bazel run --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11 java/com/example/common/foo:java_application
</pre>

downloads JDK 11 from a remote repository and run the Java application using it.

Default value is `local_jdk`.
Possible values are: `local_jdk`, `local_jdk_{{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}`,
`remotejdk_11`, `remotejdk_17`, and `remotejdk_21`.
You can extend the values by registering custom JVM using either
`local_java_repository` or `remote_java_repository` repository rules.

#### `--tool_java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-runtime-version}

The version of JVM used to execute tools that are needed during a build.
Default value is `remotejdk_11`.

#### `--jvmopt={{ "<var>" }}jvm-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#jvmopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to the Java VM. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --jvmopt="-server -Xms256m" java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

will use the server VM for launching all Java binaries and set the
startup heap size for the VM to 256 MB.

#### `--javacopt={{ "<var>" }}javac-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#javacopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to javac. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --javacopt="-g:source,lines" //myprojects:prog
</pre>

will rebuild a java_binary with the javac default debug info
(instead of the bazel default).

The option is passed to javac after the Bazel built-in default options for
javac and before the per-rule options. The last specification of
any option to javac wins. The default options for javac are:

<pre>
  -source 8 -target 8 -encoding UTF-8
</pre>

Note: Changing `--javacopt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected classes. Also note that javacopts parameters listed in
specific java_library or java_binary build rules will be placed on the javac
command line _after_ these options.

#### `--strict_java_deps (default|strict|off|warn|error)` {:#strict-java-deps}

This option controls whether javac checks for missing direct dependencies.
Java targets must explicitly declare all directly used targets as
dependencies. This flag instructs javac to determine the jars actually used
for type checking each java file, and warn/error if they are not the output
of a direct dependency of the current target.

* `off` means checking is disabled.
* `warn` means javac will generate standard java warnings of
  type `[strict]` for each missing direct dependency.
* `default`, `strict` and `error` all
  mean javac will generate errors instead of warnings, causing the current
  target to fail to build if any missing direct dependencies are found.
  This is also the default behavior when the flag is unspecified.

### Build semantics {:#build-semantics}

These options affect the build commands and/or the output file contents.

#### `--compilation_mode (fastbuild|opt|dbg)` (-c) {:#compilation-mode}

The `--compilation_mode` option (often shortened to `-c`,
especially `-c opt`) takes an argument of `fastbuild`, `dbg`
or `opt`, and affects various C/C++ code-generation
options, such as the level of optimization and the completeness of
debug tables. Bazel uses a different output directory for each
different compilation mode, so you can switch between modes without
needing to do a full rebuild _every_ time.

* `fastbuild` means build as fast as possible:
  generate minimal debugging information (`-gmlt
  -Wl,-S`), and don't optimize. This is the
  default. Note: `-DNDEBUG` will **not** be set.
* `dbg` means build with debugging enabled (`-g`),
  so that you can use gdb (or another debugger).
* `opt` means build with optimization enabled and
  with `assert()` calls disabled (`-O2 -DNDEBUG`).
  Debugging information will not be generated in `opt` mode
  unless you also pass `--copt -g`.

#### `--cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cpu}

This option specifies the target CPU architecture to be used for
the compilation of binaries during the build.

Note: A particular combination of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU is allowed only if it has been specified in the currently
used CROSSTOOL file.

#### `--action_env={{ "<var>" }}VAR=VALUE{{ "</var>" }}` {:#action-env}

Specifies the set of environment variables available during the execution of all actions.
Variables can be either specified by name, in which case the value will be taken from the
invocation environment, or by the `name=value` pair which sets the value independent of the
invocation environment.

This `--action_env` flag can be specified multiple times. If a value is assigned to the same
variable across multiple `--action_env` flags, the latest assignment wins.

#### `--experimental_action_listener={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-action-listener}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects)
instead.

The `experimental_action_listener` option instructs Bazel to use
details from the [`action_listener`](/reference/be/extra-actions#action_listener) rule specified by {{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }} to
insert [`extra_actions`](/reference/be/extra-actions#extra_action) into the build graph.

#### `--[no]experimental_extra_action_top_level_only` {:experimental-extra-action-top-level-only}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

If this option is set to true, extra actions specified by the
[ `--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) command
line option will only be scheduled for top level targets.

#### `--experimental_extra_action_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-extra-action-filter}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

The `experimental_extra_action_filter` option instructs Bazel to
filter the set of targets to schedule `extra_actions` for.

This flag is only applicable in combination with the
[`--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) flag.

By default all `extra_actions` in the transitive closure of the
requested targets-to-build get scheduled for execution.
`--experimental_extra_action_filter` will restrict scheduling to
`extra_actions` of which the owner's label matches the specified
regular expression.

The following example will limit scheduling of `extra_actions`
to only apply to actions of which the owner's label contains '/bar/':

<pre>% bazel build --experimental_action_listener=//test:al //foo/... \
  --experimental_extra_action_filter=.*/bar/.*
</pre>

#### `--host_cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cpu}

This option specifies the name of the CPU architecture that should be
used to build host tools.

#### `--android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}platform[,platform]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-platforms}

The platforms to build the transitive `deps` of
`android_binary` rules (specifically for native dependencies like C++). For
example, if a `cc_library` appears in the transitive `deps` of an
`android_binary` rule it is be built once for each platform specified with
`--android_platforms` for the `android_binary` rule, and included in the final
output.

There is no default value for this flag: a custom Android platform must be
defined and used.

One `.so` file is created and packaged in the APK for each platform specified
with `--android_platforms`. The `.so` file's name prefixes the name of the
`android_binary` rule with "lib". For example, if the name of the
`android_binary` is "foo", then the file is `libfoo.so`.

#### `--per_file_copt={{ "<var>" }}[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...{{ "</var>" }}` {:#per-file-copt}

When present, any C++ file with a label or an execution path matching one of the inclusion regex
expressions and not matching any of the exclusion expressions will be built
with the given options. The label matching uses the canonical form of the label
(i.e //`package`:`label_name`).

The execution path is the relative path to your workspace directory including the base name
(including extension) of the C++ file. It also includes any platform dependent prefixes.

Note: If only one of the label or the execution path matches the options will be used.

To match the generated files (such as genrule outputs)
Bazel can only use the execution path. In this case the regexp shouldn't start with '//'
since that doesn't match any execution paths. Package names can be used like this:
`--per_file_copt=base/.*\.pb\.cc@-g0`. This will match every
`.pb.cc` file under a directory called `base`.

This option can be used multiple times.

The option is applied regardless of the compilation mode used. For example, it is possible
to compile with `--compilation_mode=opt` and selectively compile some
files with stronger optimization turned on, or with optimization disabled.

**Caveat**: If some files are selectively compiled with debug symbols the symbols
might be stripped during linking. This can be prevented by setting
`--strip=never`.

**Syntax**: `[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...` Where
`regex` stands for a regular expression that can be prefixed with
a `+` to identify include patterns and with `-` to identify
exclude patterns. `option` stands for an arbitrary option that is passed
to the C++ compiler. If an option contains a `,` it has to be quoted like so
`\,`. Options can also contain `@`, since only the first
`@` is used to separate regular expressions from options.

**Example**:
`--per_file_copt=//foo:.*\.cc,-//foo:file\.cc@-O0,-fprofile-arcs`
adds the `-O0` and the `-fprofile-arcs` options to the command
line of the C++ compiler for all `.cc` files in `//foo/` except `file.cc`.

#### `--dynamic_mode={{ "<var>" }}mode{{ "</var>" }}` {:#dynamic-mode}

Determines whether C++ binaries will be linked dynamically, interacting with
the [linkstatic attribute](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) on build rules.

Modes:

* `default`: Allows bazel to choose whether to link dynamically.
  See [linkstatic](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) for more
  information.
* `fully`: Links all targets dynamically. This will speed up
  linking time, and reduce the size of the resulting binaries.
* `off`: Links all targets in
  [mostly static](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) mode.
  If `-static` is set in linkopts, targets will change to fully static.

#### `--fission (yes|no|[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild])` {:#fission}

Enables [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission){: .external},
which writes C++ debug information to dedicated .dwo files instead of .o files, where it would
otherwise go. This substantially reduces the input size to links and can reduce link times.

When set to `[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild]` (example:
`--fission=dbg,fastbuild`), Fission is enabled
only for the specified set of compilation modes. This is useful for bazelrc
settings. When set to `yes`, Fission is enabled
universally. When set to `no`, Fission is disabled
universally. Default is <code class='flag'>no</code>.

#### `--force_ignore_dash_static` {:#force-ignore-dash-static}

If this flag is set, any `-static` options in linkopts of
`cc_*` rules BUILD files are ignored. This is only intended as a
workaround for C++ hardening builds.

#### `--[no]force_pic` {:#force-pic}

If enabled, all C++ compilations produce position-independent code ("-fPIC"),
links prefer PIC pre-built libraries over non-PIC libraries, and links produce
position-independent executables ("-pie"). Default is disabled.

Note: Dynamically linked binaries (for example `--dynamic_mode fully`)
generate PIC code regardless of this flag's setting. So this flag is for cases
where users want PIC code explicitly generated for static links.

#### `--android_resource_shrinking` {:#flag--android_resource_shrinking}

Selects whether to perform resource shrinking for android_binary rules. Sets the default for the
[shrink_resources attribute](/reference/be/android#android_binary.shrink_resources) on
android_binary rules; see the documentation for that rule for further details. Defaults to off.

#### `--custom_malloc={{ "<var>" }}malloc-library-target{{ "</var>" }}` {:#custom-malloc}

When specified, always use the given malloc implementation, overriding all
`malloc="target"` attributes, including in those targets that use the
default (by not specifying any `malloc`).

#### `--crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#crosstool-top}

This option specifies the location of the crosstool compiler suite
to be used for all C++ compilation during a build. Bazel will look in that
location for a CROSSTOOL file and uses that to automatically determine
settings for `--compiler`.

#### `--host_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-crosstool-top}

If not specified, Bazel uses the value of `--crosstool_top` to compile
code in the exec configuration, such as tools run during the build. The main purpose of this flag
is to enable cross-compilation.

#### `--apple_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#apple-crosstool-top}

The crosstool to use for compiling C/C++ rules in the transitive `deps` of
objc_*, ios__*, and apple_* rules. For those targets, this flag overwrites
`--crosstool_top`.

#### `--compiler={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#compiler}

This option specifies the C/C++ compiler version (such as `gcc-4.1.0`)
to be used for the compilation of binaries during the build. If you want to
build with a custom crosstool, you should use a CROSSTOOL file instead of
specifying this flag.

Note: Only certain combinations of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU are allowed.

#### `--android_sdk={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-sdk}

Deprecated. This shouldn't be directly specified.

This option specifies the Android SDK/platform toolchain
and Android runtime library that will be used to build any Android-related
rule.

The Android SDK will be automatically selected if an `android_sdk_repository`
rule is defined in the WORKSPACE file.

#### `--java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--javabase=({{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }})` {:#javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_javabase={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

### Execution strategy {:#execution-strategy}

These options affect how Bazel will execute the build.
They should not have any significant effect on the output files
generated by the build. Typically their main effect is on the
speed of the build.

#### `--spawn_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#spawn-strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed.

* `standalone` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is
  deprecated. Please use `local` instead.
* `sandboxed` causes commands to be executed inside a sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that all input files, data dependencies and tools are listed as direct
  dependencies in the `srcs`, `data` and `tools` attributes.
  Bazel enables local sandboxing by default, on systems that support sandboxed execution.
* `local` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses.
* `worker` causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.
* `docker` causes commands to be executed inside a docker sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that docker is installed.
* `remote` causes commands to be executed remotely; this is only available if a
  remote executor has been configured separately.

#### `--strategy {{ "<var>" }}mnemonic{{ "</var>" }}={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed, overriding the
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) (and
[--genrule_strategy](#genrule-strategy) with mnemonic
Genrule) on a per-mnemonic basis. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

#### `--strategy_regexp={{ "<var>" }}<filter,filter,...>=<strategy>{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy-regexp}

This option specifies which strategy should be used to execute commands that have descriptions
matching a certain `regex_filter`. See
[--per_file_copt](#per-file-copt) for details on
regex_filter matching. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

The last `regex_filter` that matches the description is used. This option overrides
other flags for specifying strategy.

* Example: `--strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local` means to run actions using
  `local` strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
* Example:
  `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local' --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed`
  runs 'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `sandboxed` strategy, but reversing
  the order runs it with `local`.
* Example: `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local,sandboxed'` runs
  'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `local` strategy and falls back to
  `sandboxed` if it fails.

#### `--genrule_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#genrule-strategy}

This is a deprecated short-hand for `--strategy=Genrule={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}`.

#### `--jobs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` (-j) {:#jobs}

This option, which takes an integer argument, specifies a limit on
the number of jobs that should be executed concurrently during the
execution phase of the build.

Note : The number of concurrent jobs that Bazel will run
is determined not only by the `--jobs` setting, but also
by Bazel's scheduler, which tries to avoid running concurrent jobs
that will use up more resources (RAM or CPU) than are available,
based on some (very crude) estimates of the resource consumption
of each job. The behavior of the scheduler can be controlled by
the `--local_ram_resources` option.

#### `--progress_report_interval={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:progress-report-interval}

Bazel periodically prints a progress report on jobs that are not
finished yet (such as long running tests). This option sets the
reporting frequency, progress will be printed every `n`
seconds.

The default is 0, that means an incremental algorithm: the first
report will be printed after 10 seconds, then 30 seconds and after
that progress is reported once every minute.

When bazel is using cursor control, as specified by
[`--curses`](#curses), progress is reported every second.

#### `--local_{ram,cpu}_resources {{ "<var>" }}resources or resource expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#local-resources}

These options specify the amount of local resources (RAM in MB and number of CPU logical cores)
that Bazel can take into consideration when scheduling build and test activities to run locally. They take
an integer, or a keyword (HOST_RAM or HOST_CPUS) optionally followed by `[-|*`float`]`
(for example, `--local_cpu_resources=2`, `--local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*.5`,
`--local_cpu_resources=HOST_CPUS-1`).
The flags are independent; one or both may be set. By default, Bazel estimates
the amount of RAM and number of CPU cores directly from the local system's configuration.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_links` {:#build-runfile-links}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether the runfiles
symlinks for tests and binaries should be built in the output directory.
Using `--nobuild_runfile_links` can be useful
to validate if all targets compile without incurring the overhead
for building the runfiles trees.

When tests (or applications) are executed, their run-time data
dependencies are gathered together in one place. Within Bazel's
output tree, this "runfiles" tree is typically rooted as a sibling of
the corresponding binary or test.
During test execution, runfiles may be accessed using paths of the form
`$TEST_SRCDIR/{{ "<var>" }}canonical_repo_name{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}packagename{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}filename{{ "</var>" }}`.
The runfiles tree ensures that tests have access to all the files
upon which they have a declared dependence, and nothing more. By
default, the runfiles tree is implemented by constructing a set of
symbolic links to the required files. As the set of links grows, so
does the cost of this operation, and for some large builds it can
contribute significantly to overall build time, particularly because
each individual test (or application) requires its own runfiles tree.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_manifests` {:#build-runfile-manifests}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether runfiles manifests
should be written to the output tree.
Disabling it implies `--nobuild_runfile_links`.

It can be disabled when executing tests remotely, as runfiles trees will
be created remotely from in-memory manifests.

#### `--[no]discard_analysis_cache` {:#discard-analysis-cache}

When this option is enabled, Bazel will discard the analysis cache
right before execution starts, thus freeing up additional memory
(around 10%) for the [execution phase](/run/build#execution).
The drawback is that further incremental builds will be slower. See also
[memory-saving mode](/configure/memory).

#### `--[no]keep_going`  (-k) {:#keep-going}

As in GNU Make, the execution phase of a build stops when the first
error is encountered. Sometimes it is useful to try to build as
much as possible even in the face of errors. This option enables
that behavior, and when it is specified, the build will attempt to
build every target whose prerequisites were successfully built, but
will ignore errors.

While this option is usually associated with the execution phase of
a build, it also affects the analysis phase: if several targets are
specified in a build command, but only some of them can be
successfully analyzed, the build will stop with an error
unless `--keep_going` is specified, in which case the
build will proceed to the execution phase, but only for the targets
that were successfully analyzed.

#### `--[no]use_ijars` {:#use-ijars}

This option changes the way `java_library` targets are
compiled by Bazel. Instead of using the output of a
`java_library` for compiling dependent
`java_library` targets, Bazel will create interface jars
that contain only the signatures of non-private members (public,
protected, and default (package) access methods and fields) and use
the interface jars to compile the dependent targets. This makes it
possible to avoid recompilation when changes are only made to
method bodies or private members of a class.

Note: Using `--use_ijars` might give you a different
error message when you are accidentally referring to a non visible
member of another class: Instead of getting an error that the member
is not visible you will get an error that the member does not exist.
Changing the `--use_ijars` setting will force a recompilation of all affected
classes.

#### `--[no]interface_shared_objects` {:#interface-shared-objects}

This option enables _interface shared objects_, which makes binaries and
other shared libraries depend on the _interface_ of a shared object,
rather than its implementation. When only the implementation changes, Bazel
can avoid rebuilding targets that depend on the changed shared library
unnecessarily.

### Output selection {:#output-selection}

These options determine what to build or test.

#### `--[no]build` {:#build}

This option causes the execution phase of the build to occur; it is
on by default. When it is switched off, the execution phase is
skipped, and only the first two phases, loading and analysis, occur.

This option can be useful for validating BUILD files and detecting
errors in the inputs, without actually building anything.

#### `--[no]build_tests_only` {:#build-tests-only}

If specified, Bazel will build only what is necessary to run the `*_test`
and `test_suite` rules that were not filtered due to their
[size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters).
If specified, Bazel will ignore other targets specified on the command line.
By default, this option is disabled and Bazel will build everything
requested, including `*_test` and `test_suite` rules that are filtered out from
testing. This is useful because running
`bazel test --build_tests_only foo/...` may not detect all build
breakages in the `foo` tree.

#### `--[no]check_up_to_date` {:#check-up-to-date}

This option causes Bazel not to perform a build, but merely check
whether all specified targets are up-to-date. If so, the build
completes successfully, as usual. However, if any files are out of
date, instead of being built, an error is reported and the build
fails. This option may be useful to determine whether a build has
been performed more recently than a source edit (for example, for pre-submit
checks) without incurring the cost of a build.

See also [`--check_tests_up_to_date`](#check-tests-up-to-date).

#### `--[no]compile_one_dependency` {:#compile-one-dependency}

Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This is useful for
syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding a single
target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all
non-flag arguments are interpreted: each argument must be a
file target label or a plain filename relative to the current working
directory, and one rule that depends on each source filename is built. For
C++ and Java
sources, rules in the same language space are preferentially chosen. For
multiple rules with the same preference, the one that appears first in the
BUILD file is chosen. An explicitly named target pattern which does not
reference a source file results in an error.

#### `--save_temps` {:#save-temps}

The `--save_temps` option causes temporary outputs from the compiler to be
saved. These include .s files (assembler code), .i (preprocessed C) and .ii
(preprocessed C++) files. These outputs are often useful for debugging. Temps will only be
generated for the set of targets specified on the command line.

Note: The implementation of `--save_temps` does not use the compiler's
`-save-temps` flag. Instead, there are two passes, one with `-S`
and one with `-E`. A consequence of this is that if your build fails,
Bazel may not yet have produced the ".i" or ".ii" and ".s" files.
If you're trying to use `--save_temps` to debug a failed compilation,
you may need to also use `--keep_going` so that Bazel will still try to
produce the preprocessed files after the compilation fails.

The `--save_temps` flag currently works only for cc_* rules.

To ensure that Bazel prints the location of the additional output files, check that
your [`--show_result {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}`](#show-result)
setting is high enough.

#### `--build_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#build-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will build only targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Build tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

When running tests, Bazel ignores `--build_tag_filters` for test targets,
which are built and run even if they do not match this filter. To avoid building them, filter
test targets using `--test_tag_filters` or by explicitly excluding them.

#### `--test_size_filters={{ "<var>" }}size[,size]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-size-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given size. Test size filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test size values (small,
medium, large or enormous), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test sizes. For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=small,medium //foo:all
</pre>

and

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=-large,-enormous //foo:all
</pre>

will test only small and medium tests inside //foo.

By default, test size filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_timeout_filters={{ "<var>" }}timeout[,timeout]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given timeout. Test timeout filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test timeout values (short,
moderate, long or eternal), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test timeouts. See [--test_size_filters](#test-size-filters)
for example syntax.

By default, test timeout filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Test tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_tag_filters=performance,stress,-flaky //myproject:all
</pre>

will test targets that are tagged with either `performance` or
`stress` tag but are **not** tagged with the `flaky` tag.

By default, test tag filtering is not applied. Note that you can also filter
on test's `size` and `local` tags in
this manner.

#### `--test_lang_filters={{ "<var>" }}string[,string]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-lang-filters}

Specifies a comma-separated list of strings referring to names of test rule
classes. To refer to the rule class `foo_test`, use the string "foo". Bazel will
test (or build if `--build_tests_only` is also specified) only
targets of the referenced rule classes. To instead exclude those targets, use
the string "-foo". For example,

</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=foo,bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test only targets that are instances of `foo_test` or `bar_test` in
  `//baz/...`, while
</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=-foo,-bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test all the targets in `//baz/...` except for the `foo_test` and
  `bar_test` instances.
</p>

Tip: You can use `bazel query --output=label_kind "//p:t"` to
learn the rule class name of the target `//p:t`. And you can
look at the pair of instantiation stacks in the output of
`bazel query --output=build "//p:t"` to learn why that target
is an instance of that rule class.

Warning: The option name "--test_lang_filter" is vestigal and is therefore
unfortunately misleading; don't make assumptions about the semantics based on
the name.

#### `--test_filter={{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-filter}

Specifies a filter that the test runner may use to pick a subset of tests for
running. All targets specified in the invocation are built, but depending on
the expression only some of them may be executed; in some cases, only certain
test methods are run.

The particular interpretation of {{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }} is up to
the test framework responsible for running the test. It may be a glob,
substring, or regexp. `--test_filter` is a convenience
over passing different `--test_arg` filter arguments,
but not all frameworks support it.

### Verbosity {:#verbosity}

These options control the verbosity of Bazel's output,
either to the terminal, or to additional log files.

#### `--explain={{ "<var>" }}logfile{{ "</var>" }}` {:#explain}

This option, which requires a filename argument, causes the
dependency checker in `bazel build`'s execution phase to
explain, for each build step, either why it is being executed, or
that it is up-to-date. The explanation is written
to _logfile_.

If you are encountering unexpected rebuilds, this option can help to
understand the reason. Add it to your `.bazelrc` so that
logging occurs for all subsequent builds, and then inspect the log
when you see an execution step executed unexpectedly. This option
may carry a small performance penalty, so you might want to remove
it when it is no longer needed.

#### `--verbose_explanations` {:#verbose-explanations}

This option increases the verbosity of the explanations generated
when the [--explain](#explain) option is enabled.

In particular, if verbose explanations are enabled,
and an output file is rebuilt because the command used to
build it has changed, then the output in the explanation file will
include the full details of the new command (at least for most
commands).

Using this option may significantly increase the length of the
generated explanation file and the performance penalty of using
`--explain`.

If `--explain` is not enabled, then
`--verbose_explanations` has no effect.

#### `--profile={{ "<var>" }}file{{ "</var>" }}` {:#profile}

This option, which takes a filename argument, causes Bazel to write
profiling data into a file. The data then can be analyzed or parsed using the
`bazel analyze-profile` command. The Build profile can be useful in
understanding where Bazel's `build` command is spending its time.

#### `--[no]show_loading_progress` {:#show-loading-progress}

This option causes Bazel to output package-loading progress
messages. If it is disabled, the messages won't be shown.

#### `--[no]show_progress` {:#show-progress}

This option causes progress messages to be displayed; it is on by
default. When disabled, progress messages are suppressed.

#### `--show_progress_rate_limit={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-progress-rate}

This option causes bazel to display at most one progress message per `n` seconds,
where {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }} is a real number.
The default value for this option is 0.02, meaning bazel will limit the progress
messages to one per every 0.02 seconds.

#### `--show_result={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-result}

This option controls the printing of result information at the end
of a `bazel build` command. By default, if a single
build target was specified, Bazel prints a message stating whether
or not the target was successfully brought up-to-date, and if so,
the list of output files that the target created. If multiple
targets were specified, result information is not displayed.

While the result information may be useful for builds of a single
target or a few targets, for large builds (such as an entire top-level
project tree), this information can be overwhelming and distracting;
this option allows it to be controlled. `--show_result`
takes an integer argument, which is the maximum number of targets
for which full result information should be printed. By default,
the value is 1. Above this threshold, no result information is
shown for individual targets. Thus zero causes the result
information to be suppressed always, and a very large value causes
the result to be printed always.

Users may wish to choose a value in-between if they regularly
alternate between building a small group of targets (for example,
during the compile-edit-test cycle) and a large group of targets
(for example, when establishing a new workspace or running
regression tests). In the former case, the result information is
very useful whereas in the latter case it is less so. As with all
options, this can be specified implicitly via
the [`.bazelrc`](/run/bazelrc) file.

The files are printed so as to make it easy to copy and paste the
filename to the shell, to run built executables. The "up-to-date"
or "failed" messages for each target can be easily parsed by scripts
which drive a build.

#### `--sandbox_debug` {:#sandbox-debug}

This option causes Bazel to print extra debugging information when using sandboxing for action
execution. This option also preserves sandbox directories, so that the files visible to actions
during execution can be examined.

#### `--subcommands` (`-s`) {:#subcommands}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for each command prior to executing it.

<pre>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # //examples/cpp:hello-world [action 'Linking examples/cpp/hello-world']
  (cd /home/johndoe/.cache/bazel/_bazel_johndoe/4c084335afceb392cfbe7c31afee3a9f/bazel && \
    exec env - \
    /usr/bin/gcc -o bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world -B/usr/bin/ -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now -no-canonical-prefixes -pass-exit-codes -Wl,-S -Wl,@bazel-out/local_linux-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world-2.params)
</pre>

Where possible, commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax,
so that they can be easily copied and pasted to a shell command prompt.
(The surrounding parentheses are provided to protect your shell from the
`cd` and `exec` calls; be sure to copy them!)
However some commands are implemented internally within Bazel, such as
creating symlink trees. For these there's no command line to display.

`--subcommands=pretty_print` may be passed to print
the arguments of the command as a list rather than as a single line. This may
help make long command lines more readable.

See also [--verbose_failures](#verbose-failures), below.

For logging subcommands to a file in a tool-friendly format, see
[--execution_log_json_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_json_file)
and
[--execution_log_binary_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_binary_file).

#### `--verbose_failures` {:#verbose-failures}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for commands that failed. This can be invaluable for debugging a
failing build.

Failing commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax, suitable
for copying and pasting to a shell prompt.

### Workspace status {:#workspace-status}

Use these options to "stamp" Bazel-built binaries: to embed additional information into the
binaries, such as the source control revision or other workspace-related information. You can use
this mechanism with rules that support the `stamp` attribute, such as
`genrule`, `cc_binary`, and more.

#### `--workspace_status_command={{ "<var>" }}program{{ "</var>" }}` {:#workspace-status-command}

This flag lets you specify a binary that Bazel runs before each build. The program can report
information about the status of the workspace, such as the current source control revision.

The flag's value must be a path to a native program. On Linux/macOS this may be any executable.
On Windows this must be a native binary, typically an ".exe", ".bat", or a ".cmd" file.

The program should print zero or more key/value pairs to standard output, one entry on each line,
then exit with zero (otherwise the build fails). The key names can be anything but they may only
use upper case letters and underscores. The first space after the key name separates it from the
value. The value is the rest of the line (including additional whitespaces). Neither the key nor
the value may span multiple lines. Keys must not be duplicated.

Bazel partitions the keys into two buckets: "stable" and "volatile". (The names "stable" and
"volatile" are a bit counter-intuitive, so don't think much about them.)

Bazel then writes the key-value pairs into two files:

*   `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
    contains all keys and values where the key's name starts with `STABLE_`
*   `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
    contains the rest of the keys and their values

The contract is:

*   "stable" keys' values should change rarely, if possible. If the contents of
    `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
      change, Bazel invalidates the actions that depend on them. In
      other words, if a stable key's value changes, Bazel will rerun stamped actions.
      Therefore the stable status should not contain things like timestamps, because they change all
      the time, and would make Bazel rerun stamped actions with each build.

    Bazel always outputs the following stable keys:
    *   `BUILD_EMBED_LABEL`: value of `--embed_label`
    *   `BUILD_HOST`: the name of the host machine that Bazel is running on
    *   `BUILD_USER`: the name of the user that Bazel is running as
*   "volatile" keys' values may change often. Bazel expects them to change all the time, like
      timestamps do, and duly updates the
    `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
      file. In order to avoid
      rerunning stamped actions all the time though, **Bazel pretends that the volatile file never
      changes**. In other words, if the volatile status file is the only file whose contents has
      changed, Bazel will not invalidate actions that depend on it. If other inputs of the actions
      have changed, then Bazel reruns that action, and the action will see the updated volatile
      status, but just the volatile status changing alone will not invalidate the action.

    Bazel always outputs the following volatile keys:
      *   `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: time of the build in seconds since the Unix Epoch (the value
        of `System.currentTimeMillis()` divided by a thousand)
      *   `FORMATTED_DATE`: time of the build Formatted as
        `yyyy MMM d HH mm ss EEE`(for example 2023 Jun 2 01 44 29 Fri) in UTC.

On Linux/macOS you can pass `--workspace_status_command=/bin/true` to
disable retrieving workspace status, because `true` does nothing, successfully (exits
with zero) and prints no output. On Windows you can pass the path of MSYS's `true.exe`
for the same effect.

If the workspace status command fails (exits non-zero) for any reason, the build will fail.

Example program on Linux using Git:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo "CURRENT_TIME $(date +%s)"
echo "RANDOM_HASH $(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
echo "STABLE_GIT_COMMIT $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
echo "STABLE_USER_NAME $USER"
</pre>

Pass this program's path with `--workspace_status_command`, and the stable status file
will include the STABLE lines and the volatile status file will include the rest of the lines.

#### `--[no]stamp` {:#stamp}

This option, in conjunction with the `stamp` rule attribute, controls whether to
embed build information in binaries.

Stamping can be enabled or disabled explicitly on a per-rule basis using the
`stamp` attribute. Please refer to the Build Encyclopedia for details. When
a rule sets `stamp = -1` (the default for `*_binary` rules), this option
determines whether stamping is enabled.

Bazel never stamps binaries that are built for the exec configuration,
regardless of this option or the `stamp` attribute. For rules that set `stamp =
0` (the default for `*_test` rules), stamping is disabled regardless of
`--[no]stamp`. Specifying `--stamp` does not force targets to be rebuilt if
their dependencies have not changed.

Setting `--nostamp` is generally desireable for build performance, as it
reduces input volatility and maximizes build caching.

### Platform {:#platform}

Use these options to control the host and target platforms that configure how builds work, and to
control what execution platforms and toolchains are available to Bazel rules.

Please see background information on [Platforms](/extending/platforms) and [Toolchains](/extending/toolchains).

#### `--platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platforms}

The labels of the platform rules describing the target platforms for the
current command.

#### `--host_platform={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-platform}

The label of a platform rule that describes the host system.

#### `--extra_execution_platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-execution-platforms}

The platforms that are available as execution platforms to run actions.
Platforms can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These
platforms will be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_execution_platforms()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_execution_platforms).
This option accepts a comma-separated list of platforms in order of priority.
If the flag is passed multiple times, the most recent overrides.

#### `--extra_toolchains={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-toolchains}

The toolchain rules to be considered during toolchain resolution. Toolchains
can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These toolchains will
be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_toolchains()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_toolchains).

#### `--toolchain_resolution_debug={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#toolchain-resolution-debug}

Print debug information while finding toolchains if the toolchain type matches
the regex. Multiple regexes can be separated by commas. The regex can be
negated by using a `-` at the beginning. This might help developers
of Bazel or Starlark rules with debugging failures due to missing toolchains.

### Miscellaneous {:#miscellaneous}

#### `--flag_alias={{ "<var>" }}alias_name=target_path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flag-alias}

A convenience flag used to bind longer Starlark build settings to a shorter name. For more
details, see the
[Starlark Configurations](/extending/config#using-build-setting-aliases).

#### `--symlink_prefix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#symlink-prefix}

Changes the prefix of the generated convenience symlinks. The
default value for the symlink prefix is `bazel-` which
will create the symlinks `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`, and
`bazel-genfiles`.

If the symbolic links cannot be created for any reason, a warning is
issued but the build is still considered a success. In particular,
this allows you to build in a read-only directory or one that you have no
permission to write into. Any paths printed in informational
messages at the conclusion of a build will only use the
symlink-relative short form if the symlinks point to the expected
location; in other words, you can rely on the correctness of those
paths, even if you cannot rely on the symlinks being created.

Some common values of this option:

*   **Suppress symlink creation:**
      `--symlink_prefix=/` will cause Bazel to not
      create or update any symlinks, including the `bazel-out` and
      `bazel-<workspace>`
      symlinks. Use this option to suppress symlink creation entirely.

*   **Reduce clutter:**
      `--symlink_prefix=.bazel/` will cause Bazel to create
      symlinks called `bin` (etc) inside a hidden directory `.bazel`.

#### `--platform_suffix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platform-suffix}

Adds a suffix to the configuration short name, which is used to determine the
output directory. Setting this option to different values puts the files into
different directories, for example to improve cache hit rates for builds that
otherwise clobber each others output files, or to keep the output files around
for comparisons.

#### `--default_visibility={{ "<var>" }}(private|public){{ "</var>" }}` {:#default-visibility}

Temporary flag for testing bazel default visibility changes. Not intended for general use
but documented for completeness' sake.

#### `--starlark_cpu_profile=_file_` {:#starlark-cpu-profile}

This flag, whose value is the name of a file, causes Bazel to gather
statistics about CPU usage by all Starlark threads,
and write the profile, in [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof){: .external} format,
to the named file.

Use this option to help identify Starlark functions that
make loading and analysis slow due to excessive computation. For example:

<pre>
$ bazel build --nobuild --starlark_cpu_profile=/tmp/pprof.gz my/project/...
$ pprof /tmp/pprof.gz

For different views of the same data, try the `pprof` commands `svg`,
`web`, and `list`.

## Using Bazel for releases {:#bazel-for-releases}

Bazel is used both by software engineers during the development
cycle, and by release engineers when preparing binaries for deployment
to production. This section provides a list of tips for release
engineers using Bazel.

### Significant options {:#significant-options}

When using Bazel for release builds, the same issues arise as for other scripts
that perform a build. For more details, see
[Call Bazel from scripts](/run/scripts). In particular, the following options
are strongly recommended:

*   [`--bazelrc=/dev/null`](/run/bazelrc)
*   [`--nokeep_state_after_build`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--keep_state_after_build)

These options are also important:

*   [`--package_path`](#package-path)
*   [`--symlink_prefix`](#symlink-prefix):
    for managing builds for multiple configurations,
    it may be convenient to distinguish each build
    with a distinct identifier, such as "64bit" vs. "32bit". This option
    differentiates the `bazel-bin` (etc.) symlinks.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To build and run tests with bazel, type `bazel test` followed by
the name of the test targets.

By default, this command performs simultaneous build and test
activity, building all specified targets (including any non-test
targets specified on the command line) and testing
`*_test` and `test_suite` targets as soon as
their prerequisites are built, meaning that test execution is
interleaved with building. Doing so usually results in significant
speed gains.

### Options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-options}

#### `--cache_test_results=(yes|no|auto)` (`-t`) {:#cache-test-results}

If this option is set to 'auto' (the default) then Bazel will only rerun a test if any of the
following conditions applies:

*   Bazel detects changes in the test or its dependencies
*   the test is marked as `external`
*   multiple test runs were requested with `--runs_per_test`
*   the test failed.

If 'no', all tests will be executed unconditionally.

If 'yes', the caching behavior will be the same as auto
except that it may cache test failures and test runs with
`--runs_per_test`.

Note: Test results are _always_ saved in Bazel's output tree,
regardless of whether this option is enabled, so
you needn't have used `--cache_test_results` on the
prior run(s) of `bazel test` in order to get cache hits.
The option only affects whether Bazel will _use_ previously
saved results, not whether it will save results of the current run.

Users who have enabled this option by default in
their `.bazelrc` file may find the
abbreviations `-t` (on) or `-t-` (off)
convenient for overriding the default on a particular run.

#### `--check_tests_up_to_date` {:#check-tests-up-to-date}

This option tells Bazel not to run the tests, but to merely check and report
the cached test results. If there are any tests which have not been
previously built and run, or whose tests results are out-of-date (for example, because
the source code or the build options have changed), then Bazel will report
an error message ("test result is not up-to-date"), will record the test's
status as "NO STATUS" (in red, if color output is enabled), and will return
a non-zero exit code.

This option also implies
[`--check_up_to_date`](#check-up-to-date) behavior.

This option may be useful for pre-submit checks.

#### `--test_verbose_timeout_warnings` {:#test-verbose-timeout-warnings}

This option tells Bazel to explicitly warn the user if a test's timeout is
significantly longer than the test's actual execution time. While a test's
timeout should be set such that it is not flaky, a test that has a highly
over-generous timeout can hide real problems that crop up unexpectedly.

For instance, a test that normally executes in a minute or two should not have
a timeout of ETERNAL or LONG as these are much, much too generous.

This option is useful to help users decide on a good timeout value or
sanity check existing timeout values.

Note: Each test shard is allotted the timeout of the entire
`XX_test` target. Using this option does not affect a test's timeout
value, merely warns if Bazel thinks the timeout could be restricted further.

#### `--[no]test_keep_going` {:#test-keep-going}

By default, all tests are run to completion. If this flag is disabled,
however, the build is aborted on any non-passing test. Subsequent build steps
and test invocations are not run, and in-flight invocations are canceled.
Do not specify both `--notest_keep_going` and `--keep_going`.

#### `--flaky_test_attempts={{ "<var>" }}attempts{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flaky-test-attempts}

This option specifies the maximum number of times a test should be attempted
if it fails for any reason. A test that initially fails but eventually
succeeds is reported as `FLAKY` on the test summary. It is,
however, considered to be passed when it comes to identifying Bazel exit code
or total number of passed tests. Tests that fail all allowed attempts are
considered to be failed.

By default (when this option is not specified, or when it is set to
default), only a single attempt is allowed for regular tests, and
3 for test rules with the `flaky` attribute set. You can specify
an integer value to override the maximum limit of test attempts. Bazel allows
a maximum of 10 test attempts in order to prevent abuse of the system.

#### `--runs_per_test={{ "<var>" }}[regex@]number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#runs-per-test}

This option specifies the number of times each test should be executed. All
test executions are treated as separate tests (fallback functionality
will apply to each of them independently).

The status of a target with failing runs depends on the value of the
`--runs_per_test_detects_flakes` flag:

*  If absent, any failing run causes the entire test to fail.
*  If present and two runs from the same shard return PASS and FAIL, the test
   will receive a status of flaky (unless other failing runs cause it to
   fail).

If a single number is specified, all tests will run that many times.
Alternatively, a regular expression may be specified using the syntax
regex@number. This constrains the effect of `--runs_per_test` to targets
which match the regex (`--runs_per_test=^//pizza:.*@4` runs all tests
under `//pizza/` 4 times).
This form of `--runs_per_test` may be specified more than once.

#### `--[no]runs_per_test_detects_flakes` {:#run-per-test-detects-flakes}

If this option is specified (by default it is not), Bazel will detect flaky
test shards through `--runs_per_test`. If one or more runs for a single shard
fail and one or more runs for the same shard pass, the target will be
considered flaky with the flag. If unspecified, the target will report a
failing status.

#### `--test_summary={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-summary}

Specifies how the test result summary should be displayed.

*   `short` prints the results of each test along with the name of
    the file containing the test output if the test failed. This is the default
    value.
*   `terse` like `short`, but even shorter: only print
    information about tests which did not pass.
*   `detailed` prints each individual test case that failed, not
    only each test. The names of test output files are omitted.
*   `none` does not print test summary.

#### `--test_output={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-output}

Specifies how test output should be displayed:

*   `summary` shows a summary of whether each test passed or
    failed. Also shows the output log file name for failed tests. The summary
    will be printed at the end of the build (during the build, one would see
    just simple progress messages when tests start, pass or fail).
    This is the default behavior.
*   `errors` sends combined stdout/stderr output from failed tests
    only into the stdout immediately after test is completed, ensuring that
    test output from simultaneous tests is not interleaved with each other.
    Prints a summary at the build as per summary output above.
*   `all` is similar to `errors` but prints output for
    all tests, including those which passed.
*   `streamed` streams stdout/stderr output from each test in
    real-time.

#### `--java_debug` {:#java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine of a java test to wait for a connection from a
JDWP-compliant debugger before starting the test. This option implies `--test_output=streamed`.

#### `--[no]verbose_test_summary` {:#verbose-test-summary}

By default this option is enabled, causing test times and other additional
information (such as test attempts) to be printed to the test summary. If
`--noverbose_test_summary` is specified, test summary will
include only test name, test status and cached test indicator and will
be formatted to stay within 80 characters when possible.

#### `--test_tmpdir={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tmpdir}

Specifies temporary directory for tests executed locally. Each test will be
executed in a separate subdirectory inside this directory. The directory will
be cleaned at the beginning of the each `bazel test` command.
By default, bazel will place this directory under Bazel output base directory.

Note: This is a directory for running tests, not storing test results
(those are always stored under the `bazel-out` directory).

#### `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` OR `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout}

Overrides the timeout value for all tests by using specified number of
seconds as a new timeout value. If only one value is provided, then it will
be used for all test timeout categories.

Alternatively, four comma-separated values may be provided, specifying
individual timeouts for short, moderate, long and eternal tests (in that
order).
In either form, zero or a negative value for any of the test sizes will
be substituted by the default timeout for the given timeout categories as
defined by the page [Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia).
By default, Bazel will use these timeouts for all tests by
inferring the timeout limit from the test's size whether the size is
implicitly or explicitly set.

Tests which explicitly state their timeout category as distinct from their
size will receive the same value as if that timeout had been implicitly set by
the size tag. So a test of size 'small' which declares a 'long' timeout will
have the same effective timeout that a 'large' tests has with no explicit
timeout.

#### `--test_arg={{ "<var>" }}arg{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-arg}

Passes command-line options/flags/arguments to each test process. This
option can be used multiple times to pass several arguments. For example,
`--test_arg=--logtostderr --test_arg=--v=3`.

Note that, unlike the `bazel run` command, you can't pass test arguments
directly as in `bazel test -- target --logtostderr --v=3`. That's because
extraneous arguments passed to `bazel test` are interpreted as additional test
targets. That is, `--logtostderr` and `--v=3` would each be interpreted as a
test target. This ambiguity doesn't exist for a `bazel run` command, which only
accepts one target.

`--test_arg` can be passed to a `bazel run` command, but it's ignored unless the
target being run is a test target. (As with any other flag, if it's passed in a
`bazel run` command after a `--` token, it's not processed by Bazel but
forwarded verbatim to the executed target.)

#### `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}=_value_` OR `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-env}

Specifies additional variables that must be injected into the test
environment for each test. If {{ "<var>" }}value{{ "</var>" }} is not specified it will be
inherited from the shell environment used to start the `bazel test`
command.

The environment can be accessed from within a test by using
`System.getenv("var")` (Java), `getenv("var")` (C or C++),

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-run-under}

This specifies a prefix that the test runner will insert in front
of the test command before running it. The
{{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }} is split into words using Bourne shell
tokenization rules, and then the list of words is prepended to the
command that will be executed.

If the first word is a fully-qualified label (starts with
`//`) it is built. Then the label is substituted by the
corresponding executable location that is prepended to the command
that will be executed along with the other words.

Some caveats apply:

*   The PATH used for running tests may be different than the PATH in your environment,
    so you may need to use an **absolute path** for the `--run_under`
    command (the first word in {{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}).
*   **`stdin` is not connected**, so `--run_under`
    can't be used for interactive commands.

Examples:

<pre>
        --run_under=/usr/bin/strace
        --run_under='/usr/bin/strace -c'
        --run_under=/usr/bin/valgrind
        --run_under='/usr/bin/valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20'
</pre>

#### Test selection {:#test-selection}

As documented under [Output selection options](#output-selection),
you can filter tests by [size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters). A convenience
[general name filter](#test-filter) can forward particular
filter args to the test runner.

#### Other options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-other-options}

The syntax and the remaining options are exactly like
[`bazel build`](/run/build).

## Running executables {:#running-executables}

The `bazel run` command is similar to `bazel build`, except
it is used to build _and run_ a single target. Here is a typical session
(`//java/myapp:myapp` says hello and prints out its args):

<pre>
  % bazel run java/myapp:myapp -- --arg1 --arg2
  INFO: Analyzed target //java/myapp:myapp (13 packages loaded, 27 targets configured).
  INFO: Found 1 target...
  Target //java/myapp:myapp up-to-date:
    bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp
  INFO: Elapsed time: 14.290s, Critical Path: 5.54s, ...
  INFO: Build completed successfully, 4 total actions
  INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp &lt;args omitted&gt;
  Hello there
  $EXEC_ROOT/java/myapp/myapp
  --arg1
  --arg2
</pre>

Note: `--` is needed so that Bazel
does not interpret `--arg1` and `--arg2` as
Bazel options, but rather as part of the command line for running the binary.
Additionally, Bazel will avoid logging these arguments to the console in case
they contain sensitive information.

`bazel run` is similar, but not identical, to directly invoking
the binary built by Bazel and its behavior is different depending on whether the
binary to be invoked is a test or not.

When the binary is not a test, the current working directory will be the
runfiles tree of the binary.

When the binary is a test, the current working directory will be the exec root
and a good-faith attempt is made to replicate the environment tests are usually
run in. The emulation is not perfect, though, and tests that have multiple
shards cannot be run this way (the
`--test_sharding_strategy=disabled` command line option can be used
to work around this)

The following extra environment variables are also available to the binary:

*   `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`: the root of the workspace where the
    build was run.
*   `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY`: the current working directory where
    Bazel was run from.
*   `BUILD_ID`: the build ID of the `bazel run` invocation. This is usually
    unique, except if Bazel was run with `--script_path` and the resulting
    script is re-used.
*   `BUILD_EXECROOT`: the execution root of the `bazel run` invocation.

These can be used, for example, to interpret file names on the command line in
a user-friendly way.

### Options for `bazel run` {:#bazel-run-options}

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#run-run-under}

This has the same effect as the `--run_under` option for
`bazel test` ([see above](#test-run-under)),
except that it applies to the command being run by `bazel
run` rather than to the tests being run by `bazel test`
and cannot run under label.

#### Filtering logging outputs from Bazel

When invoking a binary with `bazel run`, Bazel prints logging output from Bazel
itself and the binary under invocation. To make the logs less noisy, you can
suppress the outputs from Bazel itself with the `--ui_event_filters` and
`--noshow_progress` flags.

For example:
`bazel run --ui_event_filters=-info,-stdout,-stderr --noshow_progress //java/myapp:myapp`

### Executing tests {:#executing-tests}

`bazel run` can also execute test binaries, which has the effect of
running the test in a close approximation of the environment described at
[Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia). Note that none of the
`--test_*` arguments have an effect when running a test in this manner except
`--test_arg` .

## Cleaning build outputs {:#cleaning-build-outputs}

### The `clean` command {:#clean}

Bazel has a `clean` command, analogous to that of Make.
It deletes the output directories for all build configurations performed
by this Bazel instance, or the entire working tree created by this
Bazel instance, and resets internal caches. If executed without any
command-line options, then the output directory for all configurations
will be cleaned.

Recall that each Bazel instance is associated with a single workspace, thus the
`clean` command will delete all outputs from all builds you've done
with that Bazel instance in that workspace.

To completely remove the entire working tree created by a Bazel
instance,  you can specify the `--expunge` option. When
executed with `--expunge`, the clean command simply
removes the entire output base tree which, in addition to the build
output, contains all temp files created by Bazel. It also
stops the Bazel server after the clean, equivalent to the [`shutdown`](#shutdown) command. For example, to
clean up all disk and memory traces of a Bazel instance, you could
specify:

<pre>
  % bazel clean --expunge
</pre>

Alternatively, you can expunge in the background by using
`--expunge_async`. It is safe to invoke a Bazel command
in the same client while the asynchronous expunge continues to run.

Note: This may introduce IO contention.

The `clean` command is provided primarily as a means of
reclaiming disk space for workspaces that are no longer needed.
Bazel's incremental rebuilds may not be
perfect so `clean` can be used to recover a consistent
state when problems arise.

Bazel's design is such that these problems are fixable and
these bugs are a high priority to be fixed. If you
ever find an incorrect incremental build, file a bug report, and report bugs in the tools
rather than using `clean`.

## Querying the dependency graph {:#querying-dependency-graph}

Bazel includes a query language for asking questions about the
dependency graph used during the build. The query language is used
by two commands: query and cquery. The major difference between the
two commands is that query runs after the [loading phase](/run/build#loading)
and cquery runs after the [analysis phase](/run/build#analysis). These tools are an
invaluable aid to many software engineering tasks.

The query language is based on the idea of
algebraic operations over graphs; it is documented in detail in

[Bazel Query Reference](/query/language).
Please refer to that document for reference, for
examples, and for query-specific command-line options.

The query tool accepts several command-line
option. `--output` selects the output format.
`--[no]keep_going` (disabled by default) causes the query
tool to continue to make progress upon errors; this behavior may be
disabled if an incomplete result is not acceptable in case of errors.

The `--[no]tool_deps` option,
enabled by default, causes dependencies in non-target configurations to be included in the
dependency graph over which the query operates.

The `--[no]implicit_deps` option, enabled by default, causes
implicit dependencies to be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An
implicit dependency is one that is not explicitly specified in the BUILD file
but added by bazel.

Example: "Show the locations of the definitions (in BUILD files) of
all genrules required to build all the tests in the PEBL tree."

<pre>
  bazel query --output location 'kind(genrule, deps(kind(".*_test rule", foo/bar/pebl/...)))'
</pre>

## Querying the action graph {:#aquery}

Caution: The aquery command is still experimental and its API will change.

The `aquery` command allows you to query for actions in your build graph.
It operates on the post-analysis configured target graph and exposes
information about actions, artifacts and their relationships.

The tool accepts several command-line options.
`--output` selects the output format. The default output format
(`text`) is human-readable, use `proto` or `textproto` for
machine-readable format.
Notably, the aquery command runs on top of a regular Bazel build and inherits
the set of options available during a build.

It supports the same set of functions that is also available to traditional
`query` but `siblings`, `buildfiles` and
`tests`.

For more details, see [Action Graph Query](/query/aquery).

## Miscellaneous commands and options {:#misc-commands-options}

### `help` {:#help}

The `help` command provides on-line help. By default, it
shows a summary of available commands and help topics, as shown in
[Building with Bazel](/run/build#quickstart).
Specifying an argument displays detailed help for a particular
topic. Most topics are Bazel commands, such as `build`
or `query`, but there are some additional help topics
that do not correspond to commands.

#### `--[no]long` (`-l`) {:#long}

By default, `bazel help [{{ "<var>" }}topic{{ "</var>" }}]` prints only a
summary of the relevant options for a topic. If
the `--long` option is specified, the type, default value
and full description of each option is also printed.

### `shutdown` {:#shutdown}

Bazel server processes may be stopped by using the `shutdown`
command. This command causes the Bazel server to exit as soon as it
becomes idle (for example, after the completion of any builds or other
commands that are currently in progress). For more details, see
[Client/server implementation](/run/client-server).

Bazel servers stop themselves after an idle timeout, so this command
is rarely necessary; however, it can be useful in scripts when it is
known that no further builds will occur in a given workspace.

`shutdown` accepts one
option, `--iff_heap_size_greater_than _n_`, which
requires an integer argument (in MB). If specified, this makes the shutdown
conditional on the amount of memory already consumed. This is
useful for scripts that initiate a lot of builds, as any memory
leaks in the Bazel server could cause it to crash spuriously on
occasion; performing a conditional restart preempts this condition.

### `info` {:#info}

The `info` command prints various values associated with
the Bazel server instance, or with a specific build configuration.
(These may be used by scripts that drive a build.)

The `info` command also permits a single (optional)
argument, which is the name of one of the keys in the list below.
In this case, `bazel info {{ "<var>" }}key{{ "</var>" }}` will print only
the value for that one key. (This is especially convenient when
scripting Bazel, as it avoids the need to pipe the result
through `sed -ne /key:/s/key://p`:

#### Configuration-independent data {:#configuration-independent-data}

*   `release`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary.
*   `workspace` the absolute path to the base workspace
    directory.
*   `install_base`: the absolute path to the installation
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user. Bazel
    installs its internally required executables below this directory.

*   `output_base`: the absolute path to the base output
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user and
    workspace combination. Bazel puts all of its scratch and build
    output below this directory.
*   `execution_root`: the absolute path to the execution
    root directory under output_base. This directory is the root for all files
    accessible to commands executed during the build, and is the working
    directory for those commands. If the workspace directory is writable, a
    symlink named `bazel-<workspace>`
    is placed there pointing to this directory.
*   `output_path`: the absolute path to the output
    directory beneath the execution root used for all files actually
    generated as a result of build commands. If the workspace directory is
    writable, a symlink named `bazel-out` is placed there pointing
    to this directory.
*   `server_pid`: the process ID of the Bazel server
     process.
*   `server_log`: the absolute path to the Bazel server's debug log file.
    This file contains debugging information for all commands over the lifetime of the
    Bazel server, and is intended for human consumption by Bazel developers and power users.
*   `command_log`: the absolute path to the command log file;
    this contains the interleaved stdout and stderr streams of the most recent
    Bazel command. Note that running `bazel info` will overwrite the
    contents of this file, since it then becomes the most recent Bazel command.
    However, the location of the command log file will not change unless you
    change the setting of the `--output_base` or
    `--output_user_root` options.
*   `used-heap-size`,
      `committed-heap-size`,
      `max-heap-size`: reports various JVM heap size
    parameters. Respectively: memory currently used, memory currently
    guaranteed to be available to the JVM from the system, maximum
    possible allocation.
*   `gc-count`, `gc-time`: The cumulative count of
    garbage collections since the start of this Bazel server and the time spent
    to perform them. Note that these values are not reset at the start of every
    build.
*   `package_path`: A colon-separated list of paths which would be
    searched for packages by bazel. Has the same format as the
    `--package_path` build command line argument.

Example: the process ID of the Bazel server.

<pre>% bazel info server_pid
1285
</pre>

#### Configuration-specific data {:#configuration-specific-data}

These data may be affected by the configuration options passed
to `bazel info`, for
example `--cpu`, `--compilation_mode`,
etc. The `info` command accepts all
the options that control dependency
analysis, since some of these determine the location of the
output directory of a build, the choice of compiler, etc.

*   `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`,
    `bazel-genfiles`: reports the absolute path to
    the `bazel-*` directories in which programs generated by the
    build are located. This is usually, though not always, the same as
    the `bazel-*` symlinks created in the base workspace directory after a
    successful build. However, if the workspace directory is read-only,
    no `bazel-*` symlinks can be created. Scripts that use
    the value reported by `bazel info`, instead of assuming the
    existence of the symlink, will be more robust.
*   The complete
    ["Make" environment](/reference/be/make-variables). If the `--show_make_env` flag is
    specified, all variables in the current configuration's "Make" environment
    are also displayed (such as `CC`, `GLIBC_VERSION`, etc).
    These are the variables accessed using the `$(CC)`
    or `varref("CC")` syntax inside BUILD files.

Example: the C++ compiler for the current configuration.
This is the `$(CC)` variable in the "Make" environment,
so the `--show_make_env` flag is needed.

<pre>
  % bazel info --show_make_env -c opt COMPILATION_MODE
  opt
</pre>

Example: the `bazel-bin` output directory for the current
configuration. This is guaranteed to be correct even in cases where
the `bazel-bin` symlink cannot be created for some reason
(such as if you are building from a read-only directory).

<pre>% bazel info --cpu=piii bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/piii-opt/bin
% bazel info --cpu=k8 bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/k8-opt/bin
</pre>

### `version` and `--version` {:#version}

The version command prints version details about the built Bazel
binary, including the changelist at which it was built and the date.
These are particularly useful in determining if you have the latest
Bazel, or if you are reporting bugs. Some of the interesting values
are:

*   `changelist`: the changelist at which this version of
    Bazel was released.
*   `label`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary. Very useful when reporting bugs.

`bazel --version`, with no other args, will emit the same output as
`bazel version --gnu_format`, except without the side-effect of potentially starting
a Bazel server or unpacking the server archive. `bazel --version` can be run from
anywhere - it does not require a workspace directory.

### `mobile-install` {:#mobile-install}

The `mobile-install` command installs apps to mobile devices.
Currently only Android devices running ART are supported.

See [bazel mobile-install](/docs/mobile-install) for more information.

Note: This command does not install the same thing that
`bazel build` produces: Bazel tweaks the app so that it can be
built, installed and re-installed quickly. This should, however, be mostly
transparent to the app.

The following options are supported:

#### `--incremental` {:#incremental}

If set, Bazel tries to install the app incrementally, that is, only those
parts that have changed since the last build. This cannot update resources
referenced from `AndroidManifest.xml`, native code or Java
resources (such as those referenced by `Class.getResource()`). If these
things change, this option must be omitted. Contrary to the spirit of Bazel
and due to limitations of the Android platform, it is the
**responsibility of the user** to know when this command is good enough and
when a full install is needed.

If you are using a device with Marshmallow or later, consider the
[`--split_apks`](#split-apks) flag.

#### `--split_apks` {:#split-apks}

Whether to use split apks to install and update the application on the device.
Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later. Note that the
[`--incremental`](#incremental) flag
is not necessary when using `--split_apks`.

#### `--start_app` {:#start-app}

Starts the app in a clean state after installing. Equivalent to `--start=COLD`.

#### `--debug_app` {:#debug-app}

Waits for debugger to be attached before starting the app in a clean state after installing.
Equivalent to `--start=DEBUG`.

#### `--start=_start_type_` {:#start}

How the app should be started after installing it. Supported _start_type_s are:

*   `NO` Does not start the app. This is the default.
*   `COLD` Starts the app from a clean state after install.
*   `WARM` Preserves and restores the application state on incremental installs.
*   `DEBUG` Waits for the debugger before starting the app in a clean state after
    install.

Note: If more than one of `--start=_start_type_`, `--start_app` or
`--debug_app` is set, the last value is used.

#### `--adb={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb}

Indicates the `adb` binary to be used.

The default is to use the adb in the Android SDK specified by
[`--android_sdk`](#android-sdk).

#### `--adb_arg={{ "<var>" }}serial{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb-arg}

Extra arguments to `adb`. These come before the subcommand in the
command line and are typically used to specify which device to install to.
For example, to select the Android device or emulator to use:

<pre>% bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=deadbeef
</pre>

invokes `adb` as

<pre>
adb -s deadbeef install ...
</pre>

#### `--incremental_install_verbosity={{ "<var>" }}number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#incremental-install-verbosity}

The verbosity for incremental install. Set to 1 for debug logging to be
printed to the console.

### `dump` {:#dump}

The `dump` command prints to stdout a dump of the
internal state of the Bazel server. This command is intended
primarily for use by Bazel developers, so the output of this command
is not specified, and is subject to change.

By default, command will just print help message outlining possible
options to dump specific areas of the Bazel state. In order to dump
internal state, at least one of the options must be specified.

Following options are supported:

*   `--action_cache` dumps action cache content.
*   `--packages` dumps package cache content.
*   `--skyframe` dumps state of internal Bazel dependency graph.
*   `--rules` dumps rule summary for each rule and aspect class,
    including counts and action counts. This includes both native and Starlark rules.
    If memory tracking is enabled, then the rules' memory consumption is also printed.
*   `--skylark_memory` dumps a
    [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) compatible .gz file to the specified path.
    You must enable memory tracking for this to work.

#### Memory tracking {:#memory-tracking}

Some `dump` commands require memory tracking. To turn this on, you have to pass
startup flags to Bazel:

*   `--host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`
*   `--host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1`

The java-agent is checked into Bazel at
`third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`, so
make sure you adjust `$BAZEL` for where you keep your Bazel repository.

Do not forget to keep passing these options to Bazel for every command or the server will
restart.

Example:

<pre>
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    build --nobuild &lt;targets&gt;

    # Dump rules
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --rules

    # Dump Starlark heap and analyze it with pprof
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --skylark_memory=$HOME/prof.gz
    % pprof -flame $HOME/prof.gz
</pre>

### `analyze-profile` {:#analyze-profile}

The `analyze-profile` command analyzes a
[JSON trace profile](/advanced/performance/json-trace-profile) previously
gathered during a Bazel invocation.

### `canonicalize-flags` {:#canonicalize-flags}

The [`canonicalize-flags`](/reference/command-line-reference#canonicalize-flags-options)
command, which takes a list of options for a Bazel command and returns a list of
options that has the same effect. The new list of options is canonical. For example,
two lists of options with the same effect are canonicalized to the same new list.

The `--for_command` option can be used to select between different
commands. At this time, only `build` and `test` are
supported. Options that the given command does not support cause an error.

Note: A small number of options cannot be reordered, because Bazel cannot
ensure that the effect is identical. Also note that this command
_does not_ expand flags from `--config`.

As an example:

<pre>
  % bazel canonicalize-flags -- --config=any_name --test_tag_filters="-lint"
  --config=any_name
  --test_tag_filters=-lint
</pre>

### Startup options {:#startup-options}

The options described in this section affect the startup of the Java
virtual machine used by Bazel server process, and they apply to all
subsequent commands handled by that server. If there is an already
running Bazel server and the startup options do not match, it will
be restarted.

All of the options described in this section must be specified using the
`--key=value` or `--key value`
syntax. Also, these options must appear _before_ the name of the Bazel
command. Use `startup --key=value` to list these in a `.bazelrc` file.

#### `--output_base={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-base}

This option requires a path argument, which must specify a
writable directory. Bazel will use this location to write all its
output. The output base is also the key by which the client locates
the Bazel server. By changing the output base, you change the server
which will handle the command.

By default, the output base is derived from the user's login name,
and the name of the workspace directory (actually, its MD5 digest),
so a typical value looks like:
`/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`.

Note: The client uses the output base to find the Bazel server
instance, so if you specify a different output base in a Bazel
command, a different server will be found (or started) to handle the
request. It's possible to perform two concurrent builds in the same
workspace directory by varying the output base.

For example:

<pre>
 OUTPUT_BASE=/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/custom_output_base
% bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}1 build //foo  &amp;  bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}2 build //bar
</pre>

In this command, the two Bazel commands run concurrently (because of
the shell `&amp;` operator), each using a different Bazel
server instance (because of the different output bases).
In contrast, if the default output base was used in both commands,
then both requests would be sent to the same server, which would
handle them sequentially: building `//foo` first, followed
by an incremental build of `//bar`.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--output_user_root={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-user-root}

Points to the root directory where output and install bases are created. The directory
must either not exist or be owned by the calling user. In the past,
this was allowed to point to a directory shared among various users
but it's not allowed any longer. This may be allowed once
[issue #11100](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11100){: .external} is addressed.

If the `--output_base` option is specified, it overrides
using `--output_user_root` to calculate the output base.

The install base location is calculated based on
`--output_user_root`, plus the MD5 identity of the Bazel embedded
binaries.

You can use the `--output_user_root` option to choose an
alternate base location for all of Bazel's output (install base and output
base) if there is a better location in your filesystem layout.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--server_javabase={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#server-javabase}

Specifies the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_ runs. The value must be a path to
the directory containing a JDK or JRE. It should not be a label.
This option should appear before any Bazel command, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --server_javabase=/usr/local/buildtools/java/jdk build //foo
</pre>

This flag does _not_ affect the JVMs used by Bazel subprocesses such as applications, tests,
tools, and so on. Use build options [--javabase](#javabase) or
[--host_javabase](#host-javabase) instead.

This flag was previously named `--host_javabase` (sometimes referred to as the
'left-hand side' `--host_javabase`), but was renamed to avoid confusion with the
build flag [--host_javabase](#host-javabase) (sometimes referred to as the
'right-hand side' `--host_javabase`).

#### `--host_jvm_args={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-jvm-args}

Specifies a startup option to be passed to the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_
runs. This can be used to set the stack size, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --host_jvm_args="-Xss256K" build //foo
</pre>

This option can be used multiple times with individual arguments. Note that
setting this flag should rarely be needed. You can also pass a space-separated list of strings,
each of which will be interpreted as a separate JVM argument, but this feature will soon be
deprecated.

That this does _not_ affect any JVMs used by
subprocesses of Bazel: applications, tests, tools, and so on. To pass
JVM options to executable Java programs, whether run by `bazel
run` or on the command-line, you should use
the `--jvm_flags` argument which
all `java_binary` and `java_test` programs
support. Alternatively for tests, use `bazel test --test_arg=--jvm_flags=foo ...`.

#### `--host_jvm_debug` {:#host-java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine to wait for a connection
from a JDWP-compliant debugger before
calling the main method of _Bazel itself_. This is primarily
intended for use by Bazel developers.

Note: This does _not_ affect any JVMs used by subprocesses of Bazel:
applications, tests, tools, etc.

#### `--autodetect_server_javabase` {:#autodetect-server-javabase}

This option causes Bazel to automatically search for an installed JDK on startup,
and to fall back to the installed JRE if the embedded JRE isn't available.
`--explicit_server_javabase` can be used to pick an explicit JRE to
run Bazel with.

#### `--batch` {:#batch}

Batch mode causes Bazel to not use the
[standard client/server mode](/run/client-server), but instead runs a bazel
java process for a single command, which has been used for more predictable
semantics with respect to signal handling, job control, and environment
variable inheritance, and is necessary for running bazel in a chroot jail.

Batch mode retains proper queueing semantics within the same output_base.
That is, simultaneous invocations will be processed in order, without overlap.
If a batch mode Bazel is run on a client with a running server, it first
kills the server before processing the command.

Bazel will run slower in batch mode, or with the alternatives described above.
This is because, among other things, the build file cache is memory-resident, so it is not
preserved between sequential batch invocations.
Therefore, using batch mode often makes more sense in cases where performance
is less critical, such as continuous builds.

Warning: `--batch` is sufficiently slower than standard
client/server mode. Additionally it might not support all of the features and optimizations which
are made possible by a persistent Bazel server. If you're using `--batch`
for the purpose of build isolation, you should use the command option
`--nokeep_state_after_build`, which guarantees that no incremental
in-memory state is kept between builds. In order to restart the Bazel server and JVM after a
build, please explicitly do so using the "shutdown" command.

#### `--max_idle_secs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#max-idle-secs}

This option specifies how long, in seconds, the Bazel server process
should wait after the last client request, before it exits. The
default value is 10800 (3 hours). `--max_idle_secs=0` will cause the
Bazel server process to persist indefinitely.

Note: this flag is only read if Bazel needs
to start a new server. Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.

Note: system sleep time where a build is not running is counted as idle time.

This option may be used by scripts that invoke Bazel to ensure that
they do not leave Bazel server processes on a user's machine when they
would not be running otherwise.
For example, a presubmit script might wish to
invoke `bazel query` to ensure that a user's pending
change does not introduce unwanted dependencies. However, if the
user has not done a recent build in that workspace, it would be
undesirable for the presubmit script to start a Bazel server just
for it to remain idle for the rest of the day.
By specifying a small value of `--max_idle_secs` in the
query request, the script can ensure that _if_ it caused a new
server to start, that server will exit promptly, but if instead
there was already a server running, that server will continue to run
until it has been idle for the usual time. Of course, the existing
server's idle timer will be reset.

#### `--[no]shutdown_on_low_sys_mem` {:#shutdown-on-low-sys-mem}

If enabled and `--max_idle_secs` is set to a positive duration,
after the build server has been idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is
low on memory. Linux only.

In addition to running an idle check corresponding to max_idle_secs, the build server will
starts monitoring available system memory after the server has been idle for some time.
If the available system memory becomes critically low, the server will exit.

#### `--[no]block_for_lock` {:#block-for-lock}

If enabled, Bazel will wait for other Bazel commands holding the
server lock to complete before progressing. If disabled, Bazel will
exit in error if it cannot immediately acquire the lock and
proceed.

Developers might use this in presubmit checks to avoid long waits caused
by another Bazel command in the same client.

#### `--io_nice_level={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#io-nice-level}

Sets a level from 0-7 for best-effort IO scheduling. 0 is highest priority,
7 is lowest. The anticipatory scheduler may only honor up to priority 4.
Negative values are ignored.

#### `--batch_cpu_scheduling` {:#batch-cpu-scheduling}

Use `batch` CPU scheduling for Bazel. This policy is useful for
workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value.
See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. This policy may provide for better system
interactivity at the expense of Bazel throughput.

### Miscellaneous options {:#misc-options}

#### `--[no]announce_rc` {:#announce-rc}

Controls whether Bazel announces startup options and command options read from
the bazelrc files when starting up.

#### `--color (yes|no|auto)` {:#color}

This option determines whether Bazel will use colors to highlight
its output on the screen.

If this option is set to `yes`, color output is enabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, Bazel will use color output only if
the output is being sent to a terminal and the TERM environment variable
is set to a value other than `dumb`, `emacs`, or `xterm-mono`.
If this option is set to `no`, color output is disabled,
regardless of whether the output is going to a terminal and regardless
of the setting of the TERM environment variable.

#### `--config={{ "<var>" }}name{{ "</var>" }}` {:#config}

Selects additional config section from
[the rc files](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-file-locations); for the current `command`,
it also pulls in the options from `command:name` if such a section exists. Can be
specified multiple times to add flags from several config sections. Expansions can refer to other
definitions (for example, expansions can be chained).

#### `--curses (yes|no|auto)` {:#curses}

This option determines whether Bazel will use cursor controls
in its screen output. This results in less scrolling data, and a more
compact, easy-to-read stream of output from Bazel. This works well with
`--color`.

If this option is set to `yes`, use of cursor controls is enabled.
If this option is set to `no`, use of cursor controls is disabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, use of cursor controls will be
enabled under the same conditions as for `--color=auto`.

#### `--[no]show_timestamps` {:#show-timestamps}

If specified, a timestamp is added to each message generated by
Bazel specifying the time at which the message was displayed.

# Sandboxing

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This article covers sandboxing in Bazel and debugging your sandboxing
environment.

*Sandboxing* is a permission restricting strategy that isolates processes from
each other or from resources in a system. For Bazel, this means restricting file
system access.

Bazel's file system sandbox runs processes in a working directory that only
contains known inputs, such that compilers and other tools don't see source
files they should not access, unless they know the absolute paths to them.

Sandboxing doesn't hide the host environment in any way. Processes can freely
access all files on the file system. However, on platforms that support user
namespaces, processes can't modify any files outside their working directory.
This ensures that the build graph doesn't have hidden dependencies that could
affect the reproducibility of the build.

More specifically, Bazel constructs an `execroot/` directory for each action,
which acts as the action's work directory at execution time. `execroot/`
contains all input files to the action and serves as the container for any
generated outputs. Bazel then uses an operating-system-provided technique,
containers on Linux and `sandbox-exec` on macOS, to constrain the action within
`execroot/`.

## Reasons for sandboxing {:#sandboxing-reasons}

-   Without action sandboxing, Bazel doesn't know if a tool uses undeclared
    input files (files that are not explicitly listed in the dependencies of an
    action). When one of the undeclared input files changes, Bazel still
    believes that the build is up-to-date and won’t rebuild the action. This can
    result in an incorrect incremental build.

-   Incorrect reuse of cache entries creates problems during remote caching. A
    bad cache entry in a shared cache affects every developer on the project,
    and wiping the entire remote cache is not a feasible solution.

-   Sandboxing mimics the behavior of remote execution — if a build works well
    with sandboxing, it will likely also work with remote execution. By making
    remote execution upload all necessary files (including local tools), you can
    significantly reduce maintenance costs for compile clusters compared to
    having to install the tools on every machine in the cluster every time you
    want to try out a new compiler or make a change to an existing tool.

## What sandbox strategy to use {:#sandboxing-strategies}

You can choose which kind of sandboxing to use, if any, with the
[strategy flags](user-manual.html#strategy-options). Using the `sandboxed`
strategy makes Bazel pick one of the sandbox implementations listed below,
preferring an OS-specific sandbox to the less hermetic generic one.
[Persistent workers](/remote/persistent) run in a generic sandbox if you pass
the `--worker_sandboxing` flag.

The `local` (a.k.a. `standalone`) strategy does not do any kind of sandboxing.
It simply executes the action's command line with the working directory set to
the execroot of your workspace.

`processwrapper-sandbox` is a sandboxing strategy that does not require any
"advanced" features - it should work on any POSIX system out of the box. It
builds a sandbox directory consisting of symlinks that point to the original
source files, executes the action's command line with the working directory set
to this directory instead of the execroot, then moves the known output artifacts
out of the sandbox into the execroot and deletes the sandbox. This prevents the
action from accidentally using any input files that are not declared and from
littering the execroot with unknown output files.

`linux-sandbox` goes one step further and builds on top of the
`processwrapper-sandbox`. Similar to what Docker does under the hood, it uses
Linux Namespaces (User, Mount, PID, Network and IPC namespaces) to isolate the
action from the host. That is, it makes the entire filesystem read-only except
for the sandbox directory, so the action cannot accidentally modify anything on
the host filesystem. This prevents situations like a buggy test accidentally rm
-rf'ing your $HOME directory. Optionally, you can also prevent the action from
accessing the network. `linux-sandbox` uses PID namespaces to prevent the action
from seeing any other processes and to reliably kill all processes (even daemons
spawned by the action) at the end.

`darwin-sandbox` is similar, but for macOS. It uses Apple's `sandbox-exec` tool
to achieve roughly the same as the Linux sandbox.

Both the `linux-sandbox` and the `darwin-sandbox` do not work in a "nested"
scenario due to restrictions in the mechanisms provided by the operating
systems. Because Docker also uses Linux namespaces for its container magic, you
cannot easily run `linux-sandbox` inside a Docker container, unless you use
`docker run --privileged`. On macOS, you cannot run `sandbox-exec` inside a
process that's already being sandboxed. Thus, in these cases, Bazel
automatically falls back to using `processwrapper-sandbox`.

If you would rather get a build error — such as to not accidentally build with a
less strict execution strategy — explicitly modify the list of execution
strategies that Bazel tries to use (for example, `bazel build
--spawn_strategy=worker,linux-sandbox`).

Dynamic execution usually requires sandboxing for local execution. To opt out,
pass the `--experimental_local_lockfree_output` flag. Dynamic execution silently
sandboxes [persistent workers](/remote/persistent).

## Downsides to sandboxing {:#sandboxing_downsides}

-   Sandboxing incurs extra setup and teardown cost. How big this cost is
    depends on many factors, including the shape of the build and the
    performance of the host OS. For Linux, sandboxed builds are rarely more than
    a few percent slower. Setting `--reuse_sandbox_directories` can
    mitigate the setup and teardown cost.

-   Sandboxing effectively disables any cache the tool may have. You can
    mitigate this by using [persistent workers](/remote/persistent), at
    the cost of weaker sandbox guarantees.

-   [Multiplex workers](/remote/multiplex) require explicit worker support
    to be sandboxed. Workers that do not support multiplex sandboxing run as
    singleplex workers under dynamic execution, which can cost extra memory.

## Debugging {:#debugging}

Follow the strategies below to debug issues with sandboxing.

### Deactivated namespaces {:#deactivated-namespaces}

On some platforms, such as
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/){: .external}
cluster nodes or Debian, user namespaces are deactivated by default due to
security concerns. If the `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` file
exists and contains a 0, you can activate user namespaces by running:

```posix-terminal
   sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

### Rule execution failures {:#rule-failures}

The sandbox may fail to execute rules because of the system setup. If you see a
message like `namespace-sandbox.c:633: execvp(argv[0], argv): No such file or
directory`, try to deactivate the sandbox with `--strategy=Genrule=local` for
genrules, and `--spawn_strategy=local` for other rules.

### Detailed debugging for build failures {:#debugging-build-failures}

If your build failed, use `--verbose_failures` and `--sandbox_debug` to make
Bazel show the exact command it ran when your build failed, including the part
that sets up the sandbox.

Example error message:

```
ERROR: path/to/your/project/BUILD:1:1: compilation of rule
'//path/to/your/project:all' failed:

Sandboxed execution failed, which may be legitimate (such as a compiler error),
or due to missing dependencies. To enter the sandbox environment for easier
debugging, run the following command in parentheses. On command failure, a bash
shell running inside the sandbox will then automatically be spawned

namespace-sandbox failed: error executing command
  (cd /some/path && \
  exec env - \
    LANG=en_US \
    PATH=/some/path/bin:/bin:/usr/bin \
    PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/some/path \
  /some/path/namespace-sandbox @/sandbox/root/path/this-sandbox-name.params --
  /some/path/to/your/some-compiler --some-params some-target)
```

You can now inspect the generated sandbox directory and see which files Bazel
created and run the command again to see how it behaves.

Note that Bazel does not delete the sandbox directory when you use
`--sandbox_debug`. Unless you are actively debugging, you should disable
`--sandbox_debug` because it fills up your disk over time.

# Apple Apps and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel to build macOS and iOS
projects. It links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to
using Bazel to build and test for those platforms.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on macOS and iOS projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building an iOS app](/start/ios-app)
*  [Objective-C build rules](/reference/be/objective-c)
*  [General Apple rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple){: .external}
*  [Integration with Xcode](/install/ide)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your macOS and iOS projects with Xcode, follow the steps
in the migration guide to start building them with Bazel:

*  [Migrating from Xcode to Bazel](/migrate/xcode)

## Apple apps and new rules {:#apple-apps-new-rules}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios.
You do not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts)
when building your macOS and iOS projects:

*  Modules:

   *  [`apple_bitcode_mode`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_bitcode_mode)
   *  [`apple_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/apple_common)
   *  [`apple_platform`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform)
   *  [`apple_platform_type`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform_type)
   *  [`apple_toolchain`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_toolchain)

*  Configuration fragments:

   *  [`apple`](/rules/lib/fragments/apple)

*  Providers:

   *  [`ObjcProvider`](/rules/lib/providers/ObjcProvider)
   *  [`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig)

## Xcode selection {:#xcode-selection}

If your build requires Xcode, Bazel will select an appropriate version based on
the `--xcode_config` and `--xcode_version` flags. The `--xcode_config` consumes
the set of available Xcode versions and sets a default version if
`--xcode_version` is not passed. This default is overridden by the
`--xcode_version` flag, as long as it is set to an Xcode version that is
represented in the `--xcode_config` target.

If you do not pass `--xcode_config`, Bazel will use the autogenerated
[`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig) that represents the
Xcode versions available on your host machine. The default version is
the newest available Xcode version. This is appropriate for local execution.

If you are performing remote builds, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `versions` attribute is a list of remotely available
[`xcode_version`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version)
targets, and whose `default` attribute is one of these
[`xcode_versions`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version).

If you are using dynamic execution, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `remote_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the remotely available Xcode versions, and whose
`local_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the locally available Xcode versions. For `local_versions`,
you probably want to use the autogenerated
`@local_config_xcode//:host_available_xcodes`. The default Xcode version is the
newest mutually available version, if there is one, otherwise the default of the
`local_versions` target. If you prefer to use the `local_versions` default
as the default, you can pass `--experimental_prefer_mutual_default=false`.

# Java and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with Java projects. It
links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building
Java projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on Java projects:

*   [Tutorial: Building a Java Project](/start/java)
*   [Java rules](/reference/be/java)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your Java projects with Maven, follow the steps in the
migration guide to start building your Maven projects with Bazel:

*   [Migrating from Maven to Bazel](/migrate/maven)

## Java versions {:#java-versions}

There are two relevant versions of Java that are set with configuration flags:

*   the version of the source files in the repository
*   the version of the Java runtime that is used to execute the code and to test
    it

### Configuring the version of the source code in your repository {:#config-source-code}

Without an additional configuration, Bazel assumes all Java source files in the
repository are written in a single Java version. To specify the version of the
sources in the repository add `build --java_language_version={ver}` to
`.bazelrc` file, where `{ver}` is for example `11`. Bazel repository owners
should set this flag so that Bazel and its users can reference the source code's
Java version number. For more details, see
[Java language version flag](/docs/user-manual#java-language-version).

### Configuring the JVM used to execute and test the code {:#config-jvm}

Bazel uses one JDK for compilation and another JVM to execute and test the code.

By default Bazel compiles the code using a JDK it downloads and it executes and
tests the code with the JVM installed on the local machine. Bazel searches for
the JVM using `JAVA_HOME` or path.

The resulting binaries are compatible with locally installed JVM in system
libraries, which means the resulting binaries depend on what is installed on the
machine.

To configure the JVM used for execution and testing use `--java_runtime_version`
flag. The default value is `local_jdk`.

### Hermetic testing and compilation {:#hermetic-testing}

To create a hermetic compile, you can use command line flag
`--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11`. The code is compiled for, executed, and
tested on the JVM downloaded from a remote repository. For more details, see
[Java runtime version flag](/docs/user-manual#java_runtime_version).

### Configuring compilation and execution of build tools in Java {:#config-build-tools-java}

There is a second pair of JDK and JVM used to build and execute tools, which are
used in the build process, but are not in the build results. That JDK and JVM
are controlled using `--tool_java_language_version` and
`--tool_java_runtime_version`. Default values are `11` and `remotejdk_11`,
respectively.

#### Compiling using locally installed JDK {:#compile-using-jdk}

Bazel by default compiles using remote JDK, because it is overriding JDK's
internals. The compilation toolchains using locally installed JDK are configured,
however not used.

To compile using locally installed JDK, that is use the compilation toolchains
for local JDK, use additional flag `--extra_toolchains=@local_jdk//:all`,
however, mind that this may not work on JDK of arbitrary vendors.

For more details, see
[configuring Java toolchains](#config-java-toolchains).

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to Java projects.

### Directory structure {:#directory-structure}

Prefer Maven's standard directory layout (sources under `src/main/java`, tests
under `src/test/java`).

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow these guidelines when creating your `BUILD` files:

*   Use one `BUILD` file per directory containing Java sources, because this
    improves build performance.

*   Every `BUILD` file should contain one `java_library` rule that looks like
    this:

    ```python
    java_library(
        name = "directory-name",
        srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
        deps = [...],
    )
    ```

*   The name of the library should be the name of the directory containing the
    `BUILD` file. This makes the label of the library shorter, that is use
    `"//package"` instead of `"//package:package"`.

*   The sources should be a non-recursive [`glob`](/reference/be/functions#glob) of
    all Java files in the directory.

*   Tests should be in a matching directory under `src/test` and depend on this
    library.

## Creating new rules for advanced Java builds {:#rules-advanced-java-builds}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios. You do
not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts) when building your Java
projects:

*   Main Java module: [`java_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/java_common)
*   Main Java provider: [`JavaInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaInfo)
*   Configuration fragment: [`java`](/rules/lib/fragments/java)
*   Other modules:

    *   [`java_annotation_processing`](/rules/lib/builtins/java_annotation_processing)
    *   [`java_compilation_info`](/rules/lib/providers/java_compilation_info)
    *   [`java_output_jars`](/rules/lib/providers/java_output_jars)
    *   [`JavaRuntimeInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaRuntimeInfo)
    *   [`JavaToolchainInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaToolchainInfo)

## Configuring the Java toolchains {:#config-java-toolchains}

Bazel uses two types of Java toolchains:
- execution, used to execute and test Java binaries, controlled with
  `--java_runtime_version` flag
- compilation, used to compile Java sources, controlled with
  `--java_language_version` flag

### Configuring additional execution toolchains {:#config-execution-toolchains}

Execution toolchain is the JVM, either local or from a repository, with some
additional information about its version, operating system, and CPU
architecture.

Java execution toolchains may added using the `local_java_repository` or
`remote_java_repository` repo rules in a module extension. Adding the rule makes
the JVM available using a flag. When multiple definitions for the same operating
system and CPU architecture are given, the first one is used.

Example configuration of local JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:local_java_repository.bzl", "local_java_repository")

local_java_repository(
  name = "additionaljdk",          # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk, --java_runtime_version=11 or --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk_11
  version = 11,                    # Optional, if not set it is autodetected
  java_home = "/usr/lib/jdk-15/",  # Path to directory containing bin/java
)
```

Example configuration of remote JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:remote_java_repository.bzl", "remote_java_repository")

remote_java_repository(
  name = "openjdk_canary_linux_arm",
  prefix = "openjdk_canary", # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=openjdk_canary_11
  version = "11",            # or --java_runtime_version=11
  target_compatible_with = [ # Specifies constraints this JVM is compatible with
    "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    "@platforms//os:linux",
  ],
  urls = ...,               # Other parameters are from http_repository rule.
  sha256 = ...,
  strip_prefix = ...
)
```

### Configuring additional compilation toolchains {:#config-compilation-toolchains}

Compilation toolchain is composed of JDK and multiple tools that Bazel uses
during the compilation and that provides additional features, such as: Error
Prone, strict Java dependencies, header compilation, Android desugaring,
coverage instrumentation, and genclass handling for IDEs.

JavaBuilder is a Bazel-bundled tool that executes compilation, and provides the
aforementioned features. Actual compilation is executed using the internal
compiler by the JDK. The JDK used for compilation is specified by `java_runtime`
attribute of the toolchain.

Bazel overrides some JDK internals. In case of JDK version > 9,
`java.compiler` and `jdk.compiler` modules are patched using JDK's flag
`--patch_module`. In case of JDK version 8, the Java compiler is patched using
`-Xbootclasspath` flag.

VanillaJavaBuilder is a second implementation of JavaBuilder,
which does not modify JDK's internal compiler and does not have any of the
additional features. VanillaJavaBuilder is not used by any of the built-in
toolchains.

In addition to JavaBuilder, Bazel uses several other tools during compilation.

The `ijar` tool processes `jar` files to remove everything except call
signatures. Resulting jars are called header jars. They are used to improve the
compilation incrementality by only recompiling downstream dependents when the
body of a function changes.

The `singlejar` tool packs together multiple `jar` files into a single one.

The `genclass` tool post-processes the output of a Java compilation, and produces
a `jar` containing only the class files for sources that were generated by
annotation processors.

The `JacocoRunner` tool runs Jacoco over instrumented files and outputs results in
LCOV format.

The `TestRunner` tool executes JUnit 4 tests in a controlled environment.

You can reconfigure the compilation by adding `default_java_toolchain` macro to
a `BUILD` file and registering it either by adding `register_toolchains` rule to
the `MODULE.bazel` file or by using
[`--extra_toolchains`](/docs/user-manual#extra-toolchains) flag.

The toolchain is only used when the `source_version` attribute matches the
value specified by `--java_language_version` flag.

Example toolchain configuration:

```python
load(
  "@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl",
  "default_java_toolchain", "DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION", "BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS", "DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS"
)

default_java_toolchain(
  name = "repository_default_toolchain",
  configuration = DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION,        # One of predefined configurations
                                                          # Other parameters are from java_toolchain rule:
  java_runtime = "@rules_java//toolchains:remote_jdk11", # JDK to use for compilation and toolchain's tools execution
  jvm_opts = BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional JDK options
  javacopts = DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional javac options
  source_version = "9",
)
```

which can be used using `--extra_toolchains=//:repository_default_toolchain_definition`
or by adding `register_toolchains("//:repository_default_toolchain_definition")`
to the workpace.

Predefined configurations:

-   `DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: all features, supports JDK versions >= 9
-   `VANILLA_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: no additional features, supports JDKs of
    arbitrary vendors.
-   `PREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but only use prebuilt
    tools (`ijar`, `singlejar`)
-   `NONPREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but all tools are
    built from sources (this may be useful on operating system with different
    libc)

#### Configuring JVM and Java compiler flags {:#config-jvm}

You may configure JVM and javac flags either with flags or with
 `default_java_toolchain` attributes.

The relevant flags are `--jvmopt`, `--host_jvmopt`, `--javacopt`,  and
`--host_javacopt`.

The relevant `default_java_toolchain` attributes are `javacopts`, `jvm_opts`,
`javabuilder_jvm_opts`, and `turbine_jvm_opts`.

#### Package specific Java compiler flags configuration {:#package-java-compiler-flags}

You can configure different Java compiler flags for specific source
files using `package_configuration` attribute of `default_java_toolchain`.
Please refer to the example below.

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl", "default_java_toolchain")

# This is a convenience macro that inherits values from Bazel's default java_toolchain
default_java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    package_configuration = [
        ":error_prone",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# This associates a set of javac flags with a set of packages
java_package_configuration(
    name = "error_prone",
    javacopts = [
        "-Xep:MissingOverride:ERROR",
    ],
    packages = ["error_prone_packages"],
)

# This is a regular package_group, which is used to specify a set of packages to apply flags to
package_group(
    name = "error_prone_packages",
    packages = [
        "//foo/...",
        "-//foo/bar/...", # this is an exclusion
    ],
)
```

#### Multiple versions of Java source code in a single repository {:#java-source-single-repo}

Bazel only supports compiling a single version of Java sources in a build.
build. This means that when building a Java test or an application, all
 dependencies are built against the same Java version.

However, separate builds may be executed using different flags.

To make the task of using different flags easier, sets of flags for a specific
version may be grouped with `.bazelrc` configs":

```python
build:java8 --java_language_version=8
build:java8 --java_runtime_version=local_jdk_8
build:java11 --java_language_version=11
build:java11 --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11
```

These configs can be used with the `--config` flag, for example
`bazel test --config=java11 //:java11_test`.

# Android Instrumentation Tests

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

![Running Android instrumentation tests in parallel](/docs/images/android_test.gif "Android instrumentation test")

**Figure 1.** Running parallel Android instrumentation tests.

[`android_instrumentation_test`](/reference/be/android#android_instrumentation_test)
allows developers to test their apps on Android emulators and devices.
It utilizes real Android framework APIs and the Android Test Library.

For hermeticity and reproducibility, Bazel creates and launches Android
emulators in a sandbox, ensuring that tests always run from a clean state. Each
test gets an isolated emulator instance, allowing tests to run in parallel
without passing states between them.

For more information on Android instrumentation tests, check out the [Android
developer
documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests.html){: .external}.

Please file issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues){: .external}.

## How it works {:#how-it-works}

When you run `bazel test` on an `android_instrumentation_test` target for the
first time, Bazel performs the following steps:

1. Builds the test APK, APK under test, and their transitive dependencies
2. Creates, boots, and caches clean emulator states
3. Starts the emulator
4. Installs the APKs
5. Runs tests utilizing the [Android Test Orchestrator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator){: .external}
6. Shuts down the emulator
7. Reports the results

In subsequent test runs, Bazel boots the emulator from the clean, cached state
created in step 2, so there are no leftover states from previous runs. Caching
emulator state also speeds up test runs.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Ensure your environment satisfies the following prerequisites:

- **Linux**. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, and 18.04.

- **Bazel 0.12.0** or later. Verify the version by running `bazel info release`.

```posix-terminal
bazel info release
```
This results in output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
release 4.1.0
```

- **KVM**. Bazel requires emulators to have [hardware
  acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#accel-check){: .external}
  with KVM on Linux. You can follow these
  [installation instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation){: .external}
  for Ubuntu.

To verify that KVM has the correct configuration, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install cpu-checker && kvm-ok
```

If it prints the following message, you have the correct configuration:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

- **Xvfb**. To run headless tests (for example, on CI servers), Bazel requires
  the [X virtual framebuffer](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml).

To install it, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install xvfb
```
Verify that `Xvfb` is installed correctly and is installed at `/usr/bin/Xvfb`
by running:

```posix-terminal
which Xvfb
```
The output is the following:

```{:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
/usr/bin/Xvfb
```

- **32-bit Libraries**. Some of the binaries used by the test infrastructure are
  32-bit, so on 64-bit machines, ensure that 32-bit binaries can be run. For
  Ubuntu, install these 32-bit libraries:

```posix-terminal
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

## Getting started {:#getting-started}

Here is a typical target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`:

![The target dependency graph on an Android instrumentation test](/docs/images/android_instrumentation_test.png "Target dependency graph")

**Figure 2.** Target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`.


### BUILD file {:#build-file}

The graph translates into a `BUILD` file like this:

```python
android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test",
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86",
)

# Test app and library
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = ":my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidTestManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_test_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_test_lib",
    srcs = glob(["javatest/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        ":my_app_lib",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
    ],
    # ...
)

# Target app and library under test
android_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_app_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_app_lib",
    srcs = glob(["java/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@maven//:androidx_appcompat_appcompat",
        "@maven//:androidx_annotation_annotation",
    ]
    # ...
)
```

The main attributes of the rule `android_instrumentation_test` are:

- `test_app`: An `android_binary` target. This target contains test code and
  dependencies like Espresso and UIAutomator. The selected `android_binary`
  target is required to specify an `instruments` attribute pointing to another
  `android_binary`, which is the app under test.

- `target_device`: An `android_device` target. This target describes the
  specifications of the Android emulator which Bazel uses to create, launch and
  run the tests. See the [section on choosing an Android
  device](#android-device-target) for more information.

The test app's `AndroidManifest.xml` must include [an `<instrumentation>`
tag](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/#configure_instrumentation_manifest_settings){: .external}.
This tag must specify the attributes for the **package of the target app** and
the **fully qualified class name of the instrumentation test runner**,
`androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`.

Here is an example `AndroidTestManifest.xml` for the test app:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="com.example.android.app.test"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">

    <instrumentation
        android:name="androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        android:targetPackage="com.example.android.app" />

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="16"
        android:targetSdkVersion="27" />

    <application >
       <!-- ... -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### WORKSPACE dependencies {:#workspace-dependencies}

In order to use this rule, your project needs to depend on these external
repositories:

- `@androidsdk`: The Android SDK. Download this through Android Studio.

- `@android_test_support`: Hosts the test runner, emulator launcher, and
  `android_device` targets. You can find the [latest release
  here](https://github.com/android/android-test/releases){: .external}.

Enable these dependencies by adding the following lines to your `WORKSPACE`
file:

```python
# Android SDK
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # or set ANDROID_HOME
)

# Android Test Support
ATS_COMMIT = "$COMMIT_HASH"
http_archive(
    name = "android_test_support",
    strip_prefix = "android-test-%s" % ATS_COMMIT,
    urls = ["https://github.com/android/android-test/archive/%s.tar.gz" % ATS_COMMIT],
)
load("@android_test_support//:repo.bzl", "android_test_repositories")
android_test_repositories()
```

## Maven dependencies {:#maven-dependencies}

For managing dependencies on Maven artifacts from repositories, such as [Google
Maven](https://maven.google.com){: .external} or [Maven Central](https://central.maven.org){: .external},
you should use a Maven resolver, such as
[`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external){: .external}.

The rest of this page shows how to use `rules_jvm_external` to
resolve and fetch dependencies from Maven repositories.

## Choosing an android_device target {:#android-device-target}

`android_instrumentation_test.target_device` specifies which Android device to
run the tests on. These `android_device` targets are defined in
[`@android_test_support`](https://github.com/google/android-testing-support-library/tree/master/tools/android/emulated_devices){: .external}.

For example, you can query for the sources for a particular target by running:

```posix-terminal
bazel query --output=build @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86
```
Which results in output that looks similar to:

```python
# .../external/android_test_support/tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43:1
android_device(
  name = "android_23_x86",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
  tags = ["requires-kvm"],
  generator_name = "generic_phone",
  generator_function = "make_device",
  generator_location = "tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43",
  vertical_resolution = 800,
  horizontal_resolution = 480,
  ram = 2048,
  screen_density = 240,
  cache = 32,
  vm_heap = 256,
  system_image = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86_images",
  default_properties = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:_android_23_x86_props",
)
```

The device target names use this template:

```
@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/{{ "<var>" }}device_type{{ "</var>" }}:{{ "<var>" }}system{{ "</var>" }}_{{ "<var>" }}api_level{{ "</var>" }}_x86_qemu2
```

In order to launch an `android_device`, the `system_image` for the selected API
level is required. To download the system image, use Android SDK's
`tools/bin/sdkmanager`. For example, to download the system image for
`generic_phone:android_23_x86`, run `$sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager
"system-images;android-23;default;x86"`.

To see the full list of supported `android_device` targets in
`@android_test_support`, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel query 'filter("x86_qemu2$", kind(android_device, @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/...:*))'
```

Bazel currently supports x86-based emulators only. For better performance, use
`QEMU2` `android_device` targets instead of `QEMU` ones.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To run tests, add these lines to your project's
`{{ '<var>' }}project root{{ '</var>' }}:{{ '<var>' }}/.bazelrc` file.

```
# Configurations for testing with Bazel
# Select a configuration by running
# `bazel test //my:target --config={headless, gui, local_device}`

# Headless instrumentation tests (No GUI)
test:headless --test_arg=--enable_display=false

# Graphical instrumentation tests. Ensure that $DISPLAY is set.
test:gui --test_env=DISPLAY
test:gui --test_arg=--enable_display=true

# Testing with a local emulator or device. Ensure that `adb devices` lists the
# device.
# Run tests serially.
test:local_device --test_strategy=exclusive
# Use the local device broker type, as opposed to WRAPPED_EMULATOR.
test:local_device --test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER
# Uncomment and set $device_id if there is more than one connected device.
# test:local_device --test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id
```

Then, use one of the configurations to run tests:

- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=gui`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=headless`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=local_device`

Use __only one configuration__ or tests will fail.

### Headless testing {:#headless-testing}

With `Xvfb`, it is possible to test with emulators without the graphical
interface, also known as headless testing. To disable the graphical interface
when running tests, pass the test argument `--enable_display=false` to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=false
```

### GUI testing {:#gui-testing}

If the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set, it's possible to enable the
graphical interface of the emulator while the test is running. To do this, pass
these test arguments to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=true --test_env=DISPLAY
```

### Testing with a local emulator or device {:#testing-local-emulator}

Bazel also supports testing directly on a locally launched emulator or connected
device. Pass the flags
`--test_strategy=exclusive` and
`--test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER` to enable local testing mode.
If there is more than one connected device, pass the flag
`--test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id` where `$device_id` is the id of
the device/emulator listed in `adb devices`.

## Sample projects {:#sample-projects}

If you are looking for canonical project samples, see the [Android testing
samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing#experimental-bazel-support){: .external}
for projects using Espresso and UIAutomator.

## Espresso setup {:#espresso-setup}

If you write UI tests with [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/){: .external}
(`androidx.test.espresso`), you can use the following snippets to set up your
Bazel workspace with the list of commonly used Espresso artifacts and their
dependencies:

```
androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core
androidx.test:rules
androidx.test:runner
javax.inject:javax.inject
org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest
junit:junit
```

One way to organize these dependencies is to create a `//:test_deps` shared
library in your `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/BUILD.bazel` file:

```python
java_library(
    name = "test_deps",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    exports = [
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_rules",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:javax_inject_javax_inject"
        "@maven//:org_hamcrest_java_hamcrest",
        "@maven//:junit_junit",
    ],
)
```

Then, add the required dependencies in `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/WORKSPACE`:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "2.8"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "79c9850690d7614ecdb72d68394f994fef7534b292c4867ce5e7dec0aa7bdfad"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
)

load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "junit:junit:4.12",
        "javax.inject:javax.inject:1",
        "org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest:2.0.0.0"
        "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1",
        "androidx.test:rules:aar:1.1.1",
        "androidx.test:runner:aar:1.1.1",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://maven.google.com",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
)
```

Finally, in your test `android_binary` target, add the `//:test_deps`
dependency:

```python
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = "//path/to:app",
    deps = [
        "//:test_deps",
        # ...
    ],
    # ...
)
```

## Tips {:#tips}

### Reading test logs {:#reading-test-logs}

Use `--test_output=errors` to print logs for failing tests, or
`--test_output=all` to print all test output. If you're looking for an
individual test log, go to
`$PROJECT_ROOT/bazel-testlogs/path/to/InstrumentationTestTargetName`.

For example, the test logs for `BasicSample` canonical project are in
`bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest`, run:

```posix-terminal
tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest
```
This results in the following output:

```none

$ tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest

### Reading emulator logs {:#reading-emulator-logs}

The emulator logs for `android_device` targets are stored in the `/tmp/`
directory with the name `emulator_xxxxx.log`, where `xxxxx` is a
randomly-generated sequence of characters.

Use this command to find the latest emulator log:

```posix-terminal
ls -1t /tmp/emulator_*.log | head -n 1
```

### Testing against multiple API levels {:#testing-multiple-apis}

If you would like to test against multiple API levels, you can use a list
comprehension to create test targets for each API level. For example:

```python
API_LEVELS = [
    "19",
    "20",
    "21",
    "22",
]

[android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test_%s" % API_LEVEL,
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_%s_x86_qemu2" % API_LEVEL,
) for API_LEVEL in API_LEVELS]
```

## Known issues {:#known-issues}

- [Forked adb server processes are not terminated after
  tests](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4853){: .external}
- While APK building works on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), testing
  only works on Linux.
- Even with `--config=local_adb`, users still need to specify
  `android_instrumentation_test.target_device`.
- If using a local device or emulator, Bazel does not uninstall the APKs after
  the test. Clean the packages by running this command:

```posix-terminal
adb shell pm list
packages com.example.android.testing | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '\r' | xargs
-L1 -t adb uninstall
```

*  Each `BUILD` file should contain one [`cc_library`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library)
   rule target per compilation unit in the directory.

*  You should granularize your C++ libraries as much as
   possible to maximize incrementality and parallelize the build.

*  If there is a single source file in `srcs`, name the library the same as
   that C++ file's name. This library should contain C++ file(s), any matching
   header file(s), and the library's direct dependencies. For example:

   ```python
   cc_library(
       name = "mylib",
       srcs = ["mylib.cc"],
       hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
       deps = [":lower-level-lib"]
   )
   ```

*  Use one `cc_test` rule target per `cc_library` target in the file. Name the
   target `[library-name]_test` and the source file `[library-name]_test.cc`.
   For example, a test target for the `mylib` library target shown above would
   look like this:

   ```python
   cc_test(
       name = "mylib_test",
       srcs = ["mylib_test.cc"],
       deps = [":mylib"]
   )
   ```

### Include paths {:#include-paths}

Follow these guidelines for include paths:

*  Make all include paths relative to the workspace directory.

*  Use quoted includes (`#include "foo/bar/baz.h"`) for non-system headers, not
   angle-brackets (`#include <foo/bar/baz.h>`).

*  Avoid using UNIX directory shortcuts, such as `.` (current directory) or `..`
   (parent directory).

*  For legacy or `third_party` code that requires includes pointing outside the
   project repository, such as external repository includes requiring a prefix,
   use the [`include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.include_prefix) and
   [`strip_include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.strip_include_prefix)
   arguments on the `cc_library` rule target.

### Toolchain features {:#toolchain-features}

The following optional [features](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#features)
can improve the hygiene of a C++ project. They can be enabled using the
`--features` command-line flag or the `features` attribute of
[`repo`](/external/overview#repo.bazel),
[`package`](/reference/be/functions#package) or `cc_*` rules:

* The `parse_headers` feature makes it so that the C++ compiler is used to parse
  (but not compile) all header files in the built targets and their dependencies
  when using the
  [`--process_headers_in_dependencies`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--process_headers_in_dependencies)
  flag. This can help catch issues in header-only libraries and ensure that
  headers are self-contained and independent of the order in which they are
  included.
* The `layering_check` feature enforces that targets only include headers
  provided by their direct dependencies. The default toolchain supports this
  feature on Linux with `clang` as the compiler.

# Configurable Build Attributes

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

**_Configurable attributes_**, commonly known as [`select()`](
/reference/be/functions#select), is a Bazel feature that lets users toggle the values
of build rule attributes at the command line.

This can be used, for example, for a multiplatform library that automatically
chooses the appropriate implementation for the architecture, or for a
feature-configurable binary that can be customized at build time.

## Example {:#configurable-build-example}

```python
# myapp/BUILD

cc_binary(
    name = "mybinary",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = select({
        ":arm_build": [":arm_lib"],
        ":x86_debug_build": [":x86_dev_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":generic_lib"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "arm_build",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_debug_build",
    values = {
        "cpu": "x86",
        "compilation_mode": "dbg",
    },
)
```

This declares a `cc_binary` that "chooses" its deps based on the flags at the
command line. Specifically, `deps` becomes:

<table>
  <tr style="background: #E9E9E9; font-weight: bold">
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>deps =</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=arm</code></td>
    <td><code>[":arm_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=x86</code></td>
    <td><code>[":x86_dev_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

`select()` serves as a placeholder for a value that will be chosen based on
*configuration conditions*, which are labels referencing [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)
targets. By using `select()` in a configurable attribute, the attribute
effectively adopts different values when different conditions hold.

Matches must be unambiguous: if multiple conditions match then either:

*  They all resolve to the same value. For example, when running on linux x86, this is unambiguous
   `{"@platforms//os:linux": "Hello", "@platforms//cpu:x86_64": "Hello"}` because both branches resolve to "hello".
*  One's `values` is a strict superset of all others'. For example, `values = {"cpu": "x86", "compilation_mode": "dbg"}`
   is an unambiguous specialization of `values = {"cpu": "x86"}`.

The built-in condition [`//conditions:default`](#default-condition) automatically matches when
nothing else does.

While this example uses `deps`, `select()` works just as well on `srcs`,
`resources`, `cmd`, and most other attributes. Only a small number of attributes
are *non-configurable*, and these are clearly annotated. For example,
`config_setting`'s own
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute is non-configurable.

## `select()` and dependencies {:#select-and-dependencies}

Certain attributes change the build parameters for all transitive dependencies
under a target. For example, `genrule`'s `tools` changes `--cpu` to the CPU of
the machine running Bazel (which, thanks to cross-compilation, may be different
than the CPU the target is built for). This is known as a
[configuration transition](/reference/glossary#transition).

Given

```python
#myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "arm_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

genrule(
    name = "my_genrule",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["g_arm.src"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["g_x86.src"],
    }),
    tools = select({
        ":arm_cpu": [":tool1"],
        ":x86_cpu": [":tool2"],
    }),
)

cc_binary(
    name = "tool1",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["armtool.cc"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["x86tool.cc"],
    }),
)
```

running

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_genrule --cpu=arm
```

on an `x86` developer machine binds the build to `g_arm.src`, `tool1`, and
`x86tool.cc`. Both of the `select`s attached to `my_genrule` use `my_genrule`'s
build parameters, which include `--cpu=arm`. The `tools` attribute changes
`--cpu` to `x86` for `tool1` and its transitive dependencies. The `select` on
`tool1` uses `tool1`'s build parameters, which include `--cpu=x86`.

## Configuration conditions {:#configuration-conditions}

Each key in a configurable attribute is a label reference to a
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting) or
[`constraint_value`](/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#constraint_value).

`config_setting` is just a collection of
expected command line flag settings. By encapsulating these in a target, it's
easy to maintain "standard" conditions users can reference from multiple places.

`constraint_value` provides support for [multi-platform behavior](#platforms).

### Built-in flags {:#built-in-flags}

Flags like `--cpu` are built into Bazel: the build tool natively understands
them for all builds in all projects. These are specified with
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    values = {
        "flag1": "value1",
        "flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

`flagN` is a flag name (without `--`, so `"cpu"` instead of `"--cpu"`). `valueN`
is the expected value for that flag. `:meaningful_condition_name` matches if
*every* entry in `values` matches. Order is irrelevant.

`valueN` is parsed as if it was set on the command line. This means:

*  `values = { "compilation_mode": "opt" }` matches `bazel build -c opt`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "true" }` matches `bazel build --force_pic=1`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "0" }` matches `bazel build --noforce_pic`

`config_setting` only supports flags that affect target behavior. For example,
[`--show_progress`](/docs/user-manual#show-progress) isn't allowed because
it only affects how Bazel reports progress to the user. Targets can't use that
flag to construct their results. The exact set of supported flags isn't
documented. In practice, most flags that "make sense" work.

### Custom flags {:#custom-flags}

You can model your own project-specific flags with
[Starlark build settings][BuildSettings]. Unlike built-in flags, these are
defined as build targets, so Bazel references them with target labels.

These are triggered with [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`flag_values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.flag_values)
attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    flag_values = {
        "//myflags:flag1": "value1",
        "//myflags:flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

Behavior is the same as for [built-in flags](#built-in-flags). See [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/select_on_build_setting){: .external}
for a working example.

[`--define`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--define)
is an alternative legacy syntax for custom flags (for example
`--define foo=bar`). This can be expressed either in the
[values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute
(`values = {"define": "foo=bar"}`) or the
[define_values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.define_values) attribute
(`define_values = {"foo": "bar"}`). `--define` is only supported for backwards
compatibility. Prefer Starlark build settings whenever possible.

`values`, `flag_values`, and `define_values` evaluate independently. The
`config_setting` matches if all values across all of them match.

## The default condition {:#default-condition}

The built-in condition `//conditions:default` matches when no other condition
matches.

Because of the "exactly one match" rule, a configurable attribute with no match
and no default condition emits a `"no matching conditions"` error. This can
protect against silent failures from unexpected settings:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

cc_library(
    name = "x86_only_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":x86_cpu": ["lib.cc"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:x86_only_lib --cpu=arm
ERROR: Configurable attribute "srcs" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //myapp:x86_cpu
```

For even clearer errors, you can set custom messages with `select()`'s
[`no_match_error`](#custom-error-messages) attribute.

## Platforms {:#platforms}

While the ability to specify multiple flags on the command line provides
flexibility, it can also be burdensome to individually set each one every time
you want to build a target.
   [Platforms](/extending/platforms)
let you consolidate these into simple bundles.

```python
# myapp/BUILD

sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":basalt": ["pyroxene.sh"],
        ":marble": ["calcite.sh"],
        "//conditions:default": ["feldspar.sh"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "basalt",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

config_setting(
    name = "marble",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)

# constraint_setting acts as an enum type, and constraint_value as an enum value.
constraint_setting(name = "color")
constraint_value(name = "black", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_value(name = "white", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_setting(name = "texture")
constraint_value(name = "smooth", constraint_setting = "texture")
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")

platform(
    name = "basalt_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

platform(
    name = "marble_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":smooth",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)
```

The platform can be specified on the command line. It activates the
`config_setting`s that contain a subset of the platform's `constraint_values`,
allowing those `config_setting`s to match in `select()` expressions.

For example, in order to set the `srcs` attribute of `my_rocks` to `calcite.sh`,
you can simply run

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --platforms=//myapp:marble_platform
```

Without platforms, this might look something like

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --define color=white --define texture=smooth --define type=metamorphic
```

`select()` can also directly read `constraint_value`s:

```python
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")
sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":igneous": ["igneous.sh"],
        ":metamorphic" ["metamorphic.sh"],
    }),
)
```

This saves the need for boilerplate `config_setting`s when you only need to
check against single values.

Platforms are still under development. See the
[documentation](/concepts/platforms) for details.

## Combining `select()`s {:#combining-selects}

`select` can appear multiple times in the same attribute:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"] +
           select({
               ":armeabi_mode": ["armeabi_src.sh"],
               ":x86_mode": ["x86_src.sh"],
           }) +
           select({
               ":opt_mode": ["opt_extras.sh"],
               ":dbg_mode": ["dbg_extras.sh"],
           }),
)
```

Note: Some restrictions apply on what can be combined in the `select`s values:
 - Duplicate labels can appear in different paths of the same `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear within the same path of a `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear across multiple combined `select`s (no matter what path)

`select` cannot appear inside another `select`. If you need to nest `selects`
and your attribute takes other targets as values, use an intermediate target:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":armeabi_mode": [":armeabi_lib"],
        ...
    }),
)

sh_library(
    name = "armeabi_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":opt_mode": ["armeabi_with_opt.sh"],
        ...
    }),
)
```

If you need a `select` to match when multiple conditions match, consider [AND
chaining](#and-chaining).

## OR chaining {:#or-chaining}

Consider the following:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config2": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config3": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Most conditions evaluate to the same dep. But this syntax is hard to read and
maintain. It would be nice to not have to repeat `[":standard_lib"]` multiple
times.

One option is to predefine the value as a BUILD variable:

```python
STANDARD_DEP = [":standard_lib"]

sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config2": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config3": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

This makes it easier to manage the dependency. But it still causes unnecessary
duplication.

For more direct support, use one of the following:

### `selects.with_or` {:#selects-with-or}

The
[with_or](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectswith_or){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing conditions directly inside a `select`:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = selects.with_or({
        (":config1", ":config2", ":config3"): [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

### `selects.config_setting_group` {:#selects-config-setting-or-group}


The
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing multiple `config_setting`s:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```


```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_or_2",
    match_any = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_or_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike `selects.with_or`, different targets can share `:config1_or_2` across
different attributes.

It's an error for multiple conditions to match unless one is an unambiguous
"specialization" of the others or they all resolve to the same value. See [here](#configurable-build-example) for details.

## AND chaining {:#and-chaining}

If you need a `select` branch to match when multiple conditions match, use the
[Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external} macro
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_and_2",
    match_all = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_and_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike OR chaining, existing `config_setting`s can't be directly `AND`ed
inside a `select`. You have to explicitly wrap them in a `config_setting_group`.

## Custom error messages {:#custom-error-messages}

By default, when no condition matches, the target the `select()` is attached to
fails with the error:

```sh
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //tools/cc_target_os:darwin
  //tools/cc_target_os:android
```

This can be customized with the [`no_match_error`](/reference/be/functions#select)
attribute:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select(
        {
            "//tools/cc_target_os:android": [":android_deps"],
            "//tools/cc_target_os:windows": [":windows_deps"],
        },
        no_match_error = "Please build with an Android or Windows toolchain",
    ),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_lib
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration: Please
build with an Android or Windows toolchain
```

## Rules compatibility {:#rules-compatibility}

Rule implementations receive the *resolved values* of configurable
attributes. For example, given:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

some_rule(
    name = "my_target",
    some_attr = select({
        ":foo_mode": [":foo"],
        ":bar_mode": [":bar"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp/my_target --define mode=foo
```

Rule implementation code sees `ctx.attr.some_attr` as `[":foo"]`.

Macros can accept `select()` clauses and pass them through to native
rules. But *they cannot directly manipulate them*. For example, there's no way
for a macro to convert

```python
select({"foo": "val"}, ...)
```

to

```python
select({"foo": "val_with_suffix"}, ...)
```

This is for two reasons.

First, macros that need to know which path a `select` will choose *cannot work*
because macros are evaluated in Bazel's [loading phase](/run/build#loading),
which occurs before flag values are known.
This is a core Bazel design restriction that's unlikely to change any time soon.

Second, macros that just need to iterate over *all* `select` paths, while
technically feasible, lack a coherent UI. Further design is necessary to change
this.

## Bazel query and cquery {:#query-and-cquery}

Bazel [`query`](/query/guide) operates over Bazel's
[loading phase](/reference/glossary#loading-phase).
This means it doesn't know what command line flags a target uses since those
flags aren't evaluated until later in the build (in the
[analysis phase](/reference/glossary#analysis-phase)).
So it can't determine which `select()` branches are chosen.

Bazel [`cquery`](/query/cquery) operates after Bazel's analysis phase, so it has
all this information and can accurately resolve `select()`s.

Consider:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
```
```python
# myapp/BUILD

string_flag(
    name = "dog_type",
    build_setting_default = "cat"
)

cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select({
        ":long": [":foo_dep"],
        ":short": [":bar_dep"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "long",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "dachshund"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "short",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "pug"},
)
```

`query` overapproximates `:my_lib`'s dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel query 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)'
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:foo_dep
//myapp:bar_dep
```

while `cquery` shows its exact dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)' --//myapp:dog_type=pug
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:bar_dep
```

## FAQ {:#faq}

### Why doesn't select() work in macros? {:#faq-select-macro}

select() *does* work in rules! See [Rules compatibility](#rules-compatibility) for
details.

The key issue this question usually means is that select() doesn't work in
*macros*. These are different than *rules*. See the
documentation on [rules](/extending/rules) and [macros](/extending/macros)
to understand the difference.
Here's an end-to-end example:

Define a rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

# Rule implementation: when an attribute is read, all select()s have already
# been resolved. So it looks like a plain old attribute just like any other.
def _impl(ctx):
    name = ctx.attr.name
    allcaps = ctx.attr.my_config_string.upper()  # This works fine on all values.
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)

# Rule declaration:
my_custom_bazel_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {"my_config_string": attr.string()},
)

# Macro declaration:
def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    allcaps = my_config_string.upper()  # This line won't work with select(s).
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)
```

Instantiate the rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_rule")
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_macro")

my_custom_bazel_rule(
    name = "happy_rule",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "second string",
    }),
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "happy_macro",
    my_config_string = "fixed string",
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "sad_macro",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "other string",
    }),
)
```

Building fails because `sad_macro` can't process the `select()`:

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:all
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
ERROR: error loading package 'myapp': Package 'myapp' contains errors.
```

Building succeeds when you comment out `sad_macro`:

```sh
# Comment out sad_macro so it doesn't mess up the build.
$ bazel build //myapp:all
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:5:3: My name is happy_macro with custom message: FIXED STRING.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/hi.bzl:15:3: My name is happy_rule with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

This is impossible to change because *by definition* macros are evaluated before
Bazel reads the build's command line flags. That means there isn't enough
information to evaluate select()s.

Macros can, however, pass `select()`s as opaque blobs to rules:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    print("Invoking macro " + name)
    my_custom_bazel_rule(
        name = name + "_as_target",
        my_config_string = my_config_string,
    )
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:sad_macro_less_sad
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:23:3: Invoking macro sad_macro_less_sad.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:15:3: My name is sad_macro_less_sad with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

### Why does select() always return true? {:#faq-boolean-select}

Because *macros* (but not rules) by definition
[can't evaluate `select()`s](#faq-select-macro), any attempt to do so
usually produces an error:

```sh
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
```

Booleans are a special case that fail silently, so you should be particularly
vigilant with them:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def my_boolean_macro(boolval):
  print("TRUE" if boolval else "FALSE")

$ cat myapp/BUILD
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_boolean_macro")
my_boolean_macro(
    boolval = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": True,
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": False,
    }),
)

$ bazel build //myapp:all --cpu=x86
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
$ bazel build //mypro:all --cpu=ppc
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
```

This happens because macros don't understand the contents of `select()`.
So what they're really evaluting is the `select()` object itself. According to
[Pythonic](https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html) design
standards, all objects aside from a very small number of exceptions
automatically return true.

### Can I read select() like a dict? {:#faq-inspectable-select}

Macros [can't](#faq-select-macro) evaluate select(s) because macros evaluate before
Bazel knows what the build's command line parameters are. Can they at least read
the `select()`'s dictionary to, for example, add a suffix to each value?

Conceptually this is possible, but [it isn't yet a Bazel feature](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8419).
What you *can* do today is prepare a straight dictionary, then feed it into a
`select()`:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
  for key in select_cmd.keys():
    select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
  native.genrule(
      name = name,
      outs = [name + ".out"],
      srcs = [],
      cmd = "echo " + select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})
        + " > $@"
  )

$ cat myapp/BUILD
selecty_genrule(
    name = "selecty",
    select_cmd = {
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "x86 mode",
    },
)

$ bazel build //testapp:selecty --cpu=x86 && cat bazel-genfiles/testapp/selecty.out
x86 mode WITH SUFFIX
```

If you'd like to support both `select()` and native types, you can do this:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
    cmd_suffix = ""
    if type(select_cmd) == "string":
        cmd_suffix = select_cmd + " WITH SUFFIX"
    elif type(select_cmd) == "dict":
        for key in select_cmd.keys():
            select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
        cmd_suffix = select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})

    native.genrule(
        name = name,
        outs = [name + ".out"],
        srcs = [],
        cmd = "echo " + cmd_suffix + "> $@",
    )
```

### Why doesn't select() work with bind()? {:#faq-select-bind}

First of all, do not use `bind()`. It is deprecated in favor of `alias()`.

The technical answer is that [`bind()`](/reference/be/workspace#bind) is a repo
rule, not a BUILD rule.

Repo rules do not have a specific configuration, and aren't evaluated in
the same way as BUILD rules. Therefore, a `select()` in a `bind()` can't
actually evaluate to any specific branch.

Instead, you should use [`alias()`](/reference/be/general#alias), with a `select()` in
the `actual` attribute, to perform this type of run-time determination. This
works correctly, since `alias()` is a BUILD rule, and is evaluated with a
specific configuration.

You can even have a `bind()` target point to an `alias()`, if needed.

```sh
$ cat WORKSPACE
workspace(name = "myapp")
bind(name = "openssl", actual = "//:ssl")
http_archive(name = "alternative", ...)
http_archive(name = "boringssl", ...)

$ cat BUILD
config_setting(
    name = "alt_ssl",
    define_values = {
        "ssl_library": "alternative",
    },
)

alias(
    name = "ssl",
    actual = select({
        "//:alt_ssl": "@alternative//:ssl",
        "//conditions:default": "@boringssl//:ssl",
    }),
)
```

With this setup, you can pass `--define ssl_library=alternative`, and any target
that depends on either `//:ssl` or `//external:ssl` will see the alternative
located at `@alternative//:ssl`.

But really, stop using `bind()`.

### Why doesn't my select() choose what I expect? {:#faq-select-choose-condition}

If `//myapp:foo` has a `select()` that doesn't choose the condition you expect,
use [cquery](/query/cquery) and `bazel config` to debug:

If `//myapp:foo` is the top-level target you're building, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery //myapp:foo <desired build flags>
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

If you're building some other target `//bar` that depends on
//myapp:foo somewhere in its subgraph, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'somepath(//bar, //myapp:foo)' <desired build flags>
//bar:bar   (3ag3193fee94a2)
//bar:intermediate_dep (12e23b9a2b534a)
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

The `(12e23b9a2b534a)` next to `//myapp:foo` is a *hash* of the
configuration that resolves `//myapp:foo`'s `select()`. You can inspect its
values with `bazel config`:

```sh
$ bazel config 12e23b9a2b534a
BuildConfigurationValue 12e23b9a2b534a
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.CoreOptions {
  cpu: darwin
  compilation_mode: fastbuild
  ...
}
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.rules.cpp.CppOptions {
  linkopt: [-Dfoo=bar]
  ...
}
...
```

Then compare this output against the settings expected by each `config_setting`.

`//myapp:foo` may exist in different configurations in the same build. See the
[cquery docs](/query/cquery) for guidance on using `somepath` to get the right
one.

Caution: To prevent restarting the Bazel server, invoke `bazel config` with the
same command line flags as the `bazel cquery`. The `config` command relies on
the configuration nodes from the still-running server of the previous command.

### Why doesn't `select()` work with platforms? {:#faq-select-platforms}

Bazel doesn't support configurable attributes checking whether a given platform
is the target platform because the semantics are unclear.

For example:

```py
platform(
    name = "x86_linux_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

In this `BUILD` file, which `select()` should be used if the target platform has both the
`@platforms//cpu:x86` and `@platforms//os:linux` constraints, but is **not** the
`:x86_linux_platform` defined here? The author of the `BUILD` file and the user
who defined the separate platform may have different ideas.

#### What should I do instead?

Instead, define a `config_setting` that matches **any** platform with
these constraints:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_x86_linux",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_x86_linux": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

This process defines specific semantics, making it clearer to users what
platforms meet the desired conditions.

#### What if I really, really want to `select` on the platform?

If your build requirements specifically require checking the platform, you
can flip the value of the `--platforms` flag in a `config_setting`:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_specific_x86_linux_platform",
    values = {
        "platforms": ["//package:x86_linux_platform"],
    },
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_specific_x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

The Bazel team doesn't endorse doing this; it overly constrains your build and
confuses users when the expected condition does not match.

<p class="lead">Fast iterative development for Android</p>

This page describes how `bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development
for Android much faster. It describes the benefits of this approach versus the
challenges of the traditional app install method.

## Summary {:#summary}

To install small changes to an Android app very quickly, do the following:

 1. Find the `android_binary` rule of the app you want to install.
 2. Disable Proguard by removing the `proguard_specs` attribute.
 3. Set the `multidex` attribute to `native`.
 4. Set the `dex_shards` attribute to `10`.
 5. Connect your device running ART (not Dalvik) over USB and enable USB
    debugging on it.
 6. Run `bazel mobile-install :your_target`. App startup will be a little
    slower than usual.
 7. Edit the code or Android resources.
 8. Run `bazel mobile-install --incremental :your_target`.
 9. Enjoy not having to wait a lot.

Some command line options to Bazel that may be useful:

 - `--adb` tells Bazel which adb binary to use
 - `--adb_arg` can be used to  add extra arguments to the command line of `adb`.
   One useful application of this is to select which device you want to install
   to if you have multiple devices connected to your workstation:
   `bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=<SERIAL> :your_target`
 - `--start_app` automatically starts the app

When in doubt, look at the
[example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/examples/android){: .external}
or [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss){: .external}.

## Introduction {:#introduction}

One of the most important attributes of a developer's toolchain is speed: there
is a world of difference between changing the code and seeing it run within a
second and having to wait minutes, sometimes hours, before you get any feedback
on whether your changes do what you expect them to.

Unfortunately, the traditional Android toolchain for building an .apk entails
many monolithic, sequential steps and all of these have to be done in order to
build an Android app. At Google, waiting five minutes to build a single-line
change was not unusual on larger projects like Google Maps.

`bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development for Android much faster by
using a combination of change pruning, work sharding, and clever manipulation of
Android internals, all without changing any of your app's code.

## Problems with traditional app installation {:#problems-app-install}

Building an Android app has some issues, including:

- Dexing. By default, "dx" is invoked exactly once in the build and it does not
know how to reuse work from previous builds: it dexes every method again, even
though only one method was changed.

- Uploading data to the device. adb does not use the full bandwidth of a USB 2.0
connection, and larger apps can take a lot of time to upload. The entire app is
uploaded, even if only small parts have changed, for example, a resource or a
single method, so this can be a major bottleneck.

- Compilation to native code. Android L introduced ART, a new Android runtime,
which compiles apps ahead-of-time rather than compiling them just-in-time like
Dalvik. This makes apps much faster at the cost of longer installation
time. This is a good tradeoff for users because they typically install an app
once and use it many times, but results in slower development where an app is
installed many times and each version is run at most a handful of times.

## The approach of `bazel mobile-install` {:#approach-mobile-install}

`bazel mobile-install `makes the following improvements:

 - Sharded dexing. After building the app's Java code, Bazel shards the class
   files into approximately equal-sized parts and invokes `dx` separately on
   them. `dx` is not invoked on shards that did not change since the last build.

 - Incremental file transfer. Android resources, .dex files, and native
   libraries are removed from the main .apk and are stored in under a separate
   mobile-install directory. This makes it possible to update code and Android
   resources independently without reinstalling the whole app. Thus,
   transferring the files takes less time and only the .dex files that have
   changed are recompiled on-device.

 - Loading parts of the app from outside the .apk. A tiny stub application is
   put into the .apk that loads Android resources, Java code and native code
   from the on-device mobile-install directory, then transfers control to the
   actual app. This is all transparent to the app, except in a few corner cases
   described below.

### Sharded Dexing {:#sharded-dexing}

Sharded dexing is reasonably straightforward: once the .jar files are built, a
[tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/ziputils/DexMapper.java){: .external}
shards them into separate .jar files of approximately equal size, then invokes
`dx` on those that were changed since the previous build. The logic that
determines which shards to dex is not specific to Android: it just uses the
general change pruning algorithm of Bazel.

The first version of the sharding algorithm simply ordered the .class files
alphabetically, then cut the list up into equal-sized parts, but this proved to
be suboptimal: if a class was added or removed (even a nested or an anonymous
one), it would cause all the classes alphabetically after it to shift by one,
resulting in dexing those shards again. Thus, it was decided to shard Java
packages rather than individual classes. Of course, this still results in
dexing many shards if a new package is added or removed, but that is much less
frequent than adding or removing a single class.

The number of shards is controlled by the BUILD file (using the
`android_binary.dex_shards` attribute). In an ideal world, Bazel would
automatically determine how many shards are best, but Bazel currently must know
the set of actions (for example, commands to be executed during the build) before
executing any of them, so it cannot determine the optimal number of shards
because it doesn't know how many Java classes there will eventually be in the
app. Generally speaking, the more shards, the faster the build and the
installation will be, but the slower app startup becomes, because the dynamic
linker has to do more work. The sweet spot is usually between 10 and 50 shards.

### Incremental file transfer {:#incremental-file-transfer}

After building the app, the next step is to install it, preferably with the
least effort possible. Installation consists of the following steps:

 1. Installing the .apk (typically using `adb install`)
 2. Uploading the .dex files, Android resources, and native libraries to the
    mobile-install directory

There is not much incrementality in the first step: the app is either installed
or not. Bazel currently relies on the user to indicate if it should do this step
through the `--incremental` command line option because it cannot determine in
all cases if it is necessary.

In the second step, the app's files from the build are compared to an on-device
manifest file that lists which app files are on the device and their
checksums. Any new files are uploaded to the device, any files that have changed
are updated, and any files that have been removed are deleted from the
device. If the manifest is not present, it is assumed that every file needs to
be uploaded.

Note that it is possible to fool the incremental installation algorithm by
changing a file on the device, but not its checksum in the manifest. This could
have been safeguarded against by computing the checksum of the files on the
device, but this was deemed to be not worth the increase in installation time.

### The Stub application {:#stub-app}

The stub application is where the magic to load the dexes, native code and
Android resources from the on-device `mobile-install` directory happens.

The actual loading is implemented by subclassing `BaseDexClassLoader` and is a
reasonably well-documented technique. This happens before any of the app's
classes are loaded, so that any application classes that are in the apk can be
placed in the on-device `mobile-install` directory so that they can be updated
without `adb install`.

This needs to happen before any of the
classes of the app are loaded, so that no application class needs to be in the
.apk which would mean that changes to those classes would require a full
re-install.

This is accomplished by replacing the `Application` class specified in
`AndroidManifest.xml` with the
[stub application](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/incrementaldeployment/StubApplication.java){: .external}. This
takes control when the app is started, and tweaks the class loader and the
resource manager appropriately at the earliest moment (its constructor) using
Java reflection on the internals of the Android framework.

Another thing the stub application does is to copy the native libraries
installed by mobile-install to another location. This is necessary because the
dynamic linker needs the `X` bit to be set on the files, which is not possible to
do for any location accessible by a non-root `adb`.

Once all these things are done, the stub application then instantiates the
actual `Application` class, changing all references to itself to the actual
application within the Android framework.

## Results {:#results}

### Performance {:#performance}

In general, `bazel mobile-install` results in a 4x to 10x speedup of building
and installing large apps after a small change.

The following numbers were computed for a few Google products:

<img src="/docs/images/mobile-install-performance.svg"/>

This, of course, depends on the nature of the change: recompilation after
changing a base library takes more time.

### Limitations {:#limitations}

The tricks the stub application plays don't work in every case.
The following cases highlight where it does not work as expected:

 - When `Context` is cast to the `Application` class in
   `ContentProvider#onCreate()`. This method is called during application
   startup before we have a chance to replace the instance of the `Application`
   class, therefore, `ContentProvider` will still reference the stub application
   instead of the real one. Arguably, this is not a bug since you are not
   supposed to downcast `Context` like this, but this seems to happen in a few
   apps at Google.

 - Resources installed by `bazel mobile-install` are only available from within
   the app. If resources are accessed by other apps via
   `PackageManager#getApplicationResources()`, these resources will be from the
   last non-incremental install.

 - Devices that aren't running ART. While the stub application works well on
   Froyo and later, Dalvik has a bug that makes it think that the app is
   incorrect if its code is distributed over multiple .dex files in certain
   cases, for example, when Java annotations are used in a
   [specific](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78144){: .external}
   way. As long as your app doesn't tickle these bugs, it should work with Dalvik,
   too (note, however, that support for old Android versions isn't exactly our
   focus)

# Using the Android Native Development Kit with Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, please start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

## Overview {:#overview}

Bazel can run in many different build configurations, including several that use
the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) toolchain. This means that normal
`cc_library` and `cc_binary` rules can be compiled for Android directly within
Bazel. Bazel accomplishes this by using the `android_ndk_repository` repository
rule.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Please ensure that you have installed the Android SDK and NDK.

To set up the SDK and NDK, add the following snippet to your `WORKSPACE`:

```python
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidsdk".
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.
)

android_ndk_repository(
    name = "androidndk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidndk".
    path = "/path/to/ndk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable is set.
)
```

For more information about the `android_ndk_repository` rule, see the [Build
Encyclopedia entry](/reference/be/android#android_ndk_repository).

If you're using a recent version of the Android NDK (r22 and beyond), use the
Starlark implementation of `android_ndk_repository`.
Follow the instructions in
[its README](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk).

## Quick start {:#quick-start}

To build C++ for Android, simply add `cc_library` dependencies to your
`android_binary` or `android_library` rules.

For example, given the following `BUILD` file for an Android app:

```python
# In <project>/app/src/main/BUILD.bazel

cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
)

android_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["java/com/example/android/bazel/MainActivity.java"],
    resource_files = glob(["res/**/*"]),
    custom_package = "com.example.android.bazel",
    manifest = "LibraryManifest.xml",
    deps = [":jni_lib"],
)

android_binary(
    name = "app",
    deps = [":lib"],
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
)
```

This `BUILD` file results in the following target graph:

![Example results](/docs/images/android_ndk.png "Build graph results")

**Figure 1.** Build graph of Android project with cc_library dependencies.

To build the app, simply run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //app/src/main:app
```

The `bazel build` command compiles the Java files, Android resource files, and
`cc_library` rules, and packages everything into an APK:

```posix-terminal
$ zipinfo -1 bazel-bin/app/src/main/app.apk
nativedeps
lib/armeabi-v7a/libapp.so
classes.dex
AndroidManifest.xml
...
res/...
...
META-INF/CERT.SF
META-INF/CERT.RSA
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

Bazel compiles all of the cc_libraries into a single shared object (`.so`) file,
targeted for the `armeabi-v7a` ABI by default. To change this or build for
multiple ABIs at the same time, see the section on [configuring the target
ABI](#configuring-target-abi).

## Example setup {:#example-setup}

This example is available in the [Bazel examples
repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/master/android/ndk){: .external}.

In the `BUILD.bazel` file, three targets are defined with the `android_binary`,
`android_library`, and `cc_library` rules.

The `android_binary` top-level target builds the APK.

The `cc_library` target contains a single C++ source file with a JNI function
implementation:

```c++
#include <jni.h>
#include <string>

extern "C"
JNIEXPORT jstring

JNICALL
Java_com_example_android_bazel_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv *env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    std::string hello = "Hello from C++";
    return env->NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
}
```

The `android_library` target specifies the Java sources, resource files, and the
dependency on a `cc_library` target. For this example, `MainActivity.java` loads
the shared object file `libapp.so`, and defines the method signature for the JNI
function:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("app");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       // ...
    }

    public native String stringFromJNI();

}
```

Note: The name of the native library is derived from the name of the top
level `android_binary` target. In this example, it is `app`.

## Configuring the target ABI {:#configuring-target-abi}

To configure the target ABI, use the `--android_platforms` flag as follows:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}comma-separated list of platforms{{ "</var>" }}
```

Just like the `--platforms` flag, the values passed to `--android_platforms` are
the labels of [`platform`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#platform)
targets, using standard constraint values to describe your device.

For example, for an Android device with a 64-bit ARM processor, you'd define
your platform like this:

```py
platform(
    name = "android_arm64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:android",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm64",
    ],
)
```

Every Android `platform` should use the [`@platforms//os:android`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms/blob/33a3b209f94856193266871b1545054afb90bb28/os/BUILD#L36)
OS constraint. To migrate the CPU constraint, check this chart:

CPU Value     | Platform
------------- | ------------------------------------------
`armeabi-v7a` | `@platforms//cpu:armv7`
`arm64-v8a`   | `@platforms//cpu:arm64`
`x86`         | `@platforms//cpu:x86_32`
`x86_64`      | `@platforms//cpu:x86_64`

And, of course, for a multi-architecture APK, you pass multiple labels, for
example: `--android_platforms=//:arm64,//:x86_64` (assuming you defined those in
your top-level `BUILD.bazel` file).

Bazel is unable to select a default Android platform, so one must be defined and
specified with `--android_platforms`.

Depending on the NDK revision and Android API level, the following ABIs are
available:

| NDK revision | ABIs                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 16 and lower | armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, mips64, x86, x86\_64 |
| 17 and above | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86\_64                        |

See [the NDK docs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html){: .external}
for more information on these ABIs.

Multi-ABI Fat APKs are not recommended for release builds since they increase
the size of the APK, but can be useful for development and QA builds.

## Selecting a C++ standard {:#selecting-c-standard}

Use the following flags to build according to a C++ standard:

| C++ Standard | Flag                    |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| C++98        | Default, no flag needed |
| C++11        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++11`   |
| C++14        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++14`   |
| C++17        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++17`   |

For example:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --cxxopt=-std=c++11
```

Read more about passing compiler and linker flags with `--cxxopt`, `--copt`, and
`--linkopt` in the [User Manual](/docs/user-manual#cxxopt).

Compiler and linker flags can also be specified as attributes in `cc_library`
using `copts` and `linkopts`. For example:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
    copts = ["-std=c++11"],
    linkopts = ["-ldl"], # link against libdl
)
```

## Building a `cc_library` for Android without using `android_binary` {:#cclibrary-android}

To build a standalone `cc_binary` or `cc_library` for Android without using an
`android_binary`, use the `--platforms` flag.

For example, assuming you have defined Android platforms in
`my/platforms/BUILD`:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target \
      --platforms=//my/platforms:x86_64
```

With this approach, the entire build tree is affected.

Note: All of the targets on the command line must be compatible with
building for Android when specifying these flags, which may make it difficult to
use [Bazel wild-cards](/run/build#specifying-build-targets) like
`/...` and `:all`.

These flags can be put into a `bazelrc` config (one for each ABI), in
`{{ "<var>" }}project{{ "</var>" }}/.bazelrc`:

```
common:android_x86 --platforms=//my/platforms:x86

common:android_armeabi-v7a --platforms=//my/platforms:armeabi-v7a

# In general
common:android_<abi> --platforms=//my/platforms:<abi>
```

Then, to build a `cc_library` for `x86` for example, run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target --config=android_x86
```

In general, use this method for low-level targets (like `cc_library`) or when
you know exactly what you're building; rely on the automatic configuration
transitions from `android_binary` for high-level targets where you're expecting
to build a lot of targets you don't control.

# C++ Toolchain Configuration

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

## Overview {:#overview}

To invoke the compiler with the right options, Bazel needs some knowledge about
the compiler internals, such as include directories and important flags.
In other words, Bazel needs a simplified model of the compiler to understand its
workings.

Bazel needs to know the following:

* Whether the compiler supports thinLTO, modules, dynamic linking, or PIC
  (position independent code).
* Paths to the required tools such as gcc, ld, ar, objcopy, and so on.
* The built-in system include directories. Bazel needs these to validate that
  all headers that were included in the source file were properly declared in
  the `BUILD` file.
* The default sysroot.
* Which flags to use for compilation, linking, archiving.
* Which flags to use for the supported compilation modes (opt, dbg, fastbuild).
* Make variables specifically required by the compiler.

If the compiler has support for multiple architectures, Bazel needs to configure
them separately.

[`CcToolchainConfigInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/CcToolchainConfigInfo) is a provider that provides the necessary level of
granularity for configuring the behavior of Bazel's C++ rules. By default,
Bazel automatically configures `CcToolchainConfigInfo` for your build, but you
have the option to configure it manually. For that, you need a Starlark rule
that provides the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` and you need to point the
[`toolchain_config`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain.toolchain_config) attribute of the
[`cc_toolchain`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain) to your rule.
You can create the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` by calling
[`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info()`](/rules/lib/toplevel/cc_common#create_cc_toolchain_config_info).
You can find Starlark constructors for all structs you'll need in the process in
[`@rules_cc//cc:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/blob/master/cc/cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl){: .external}.


When a C++ target enters the analysis phase, Bazel selects the appropriate
`cc_toolchain` target based on the `BUILD` file, and obtains the
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider from the target specified in the
`cc_toolchain.toolchain_config` attribute. The `cc_toolchain` target
passes this information to the C++ target through a `CcToolchainProvider`.

For example, a compile or link action, instantiated by a rule such as
`cc_binary` or `cc_library`, needs the following information:

*   The compiler or linker to use
*   Command-line flags for the compiler/linker
*   Configuration flags passed through the `--copt/--linkopt` options
*   Environment variables
*   Artifacts needed in the sandbox in which the action executes

All of the above information except the artifacts required in the sandbox is
specified in the Starlark target that the `cc_toolchain` points to.

The artifacts to be shipped to the sandbox are declared in the `cc_toolchain`
target. For example, with the `cc_toolchain.linker_files` attribute you can
specify the linker binary and toolchain libraries to ship into the sandbox.

## Toolchain selection {:#toolchain-selection}

The toolchain selection logic operates as follows:

1.  User specifies a `cc_toolchain_suite` target in the `BUILD` file and points
    Bazel to the target using the
    [`--crosstool_top` option](/docs/user-manual#flag--crosstool_top).

2.  The `cc_toolchain_suite` target references multiple toolchains. The
    values of the `--cpu` and `--compiler` flags determine which of those
    toolchains is selected, either based only on the `--cpu` flag value, or
    based on a joint `--cpu | --compiler` value. The selection process is as
    follows:

  * If the `--compiler` option is specified, Bazel selects the
        corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
        attribute with `--cpu | --compiler`. If Bazel does not find
        a corresponding entry, it throws an error.

  * If the `--compiler` option is not specified, Bazel selects
    the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
    attribute with just `--cpu`.

  * If no flags are specified, Bazel inspects the host system and selects a
    `--cpu` value based on its findings. See the
    [inspection mechanism code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/1b73bc37e184e71651eb631223dcce321ba16211:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/AutoCpuConverter.java).

Once a toolchain has been selected, corresponding `feature` and `action_config`
objects in the Starlark rule govern the configuration of the build (that is,
items described later). These messages allow the implementation of
fully fledged C++ features in Bazel without modifying the
Bazel binary. C++ rules support multiple unique actions documented in detail
[in the Bazel source code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/4f547a7ea86df80e4c76145ffdbb0c8b75ba3afa:tools/build_defs/cc/action_names.bzl).

## Features {:#features}

A feature is an entity that requires command-line flags, actions,
constraints on the execution environment, or dependency alterations. A feature
can be something as simple as allowing `BUILD` files to select configurations of
flags, such as `treat_warnings_as_errors`, or interact with the C++ rules and
include new compile actions and inputs to the compilation, such as
`header_modules` or `thin_lto`.

Ideally, `CcToolchainConfigInfo` contains a list of features, where each
feature consists of one or more flag groups, each defining a list of flags
that apply to specific Bazel actions.

A feature is specified by name, which allows full decoupling of the Starlark
rule configuration from Bazel releases. In other words, a Bazel release does not
affect the behavior of `CcToolchainConfigInfo` configurations as long as those
configurations do not require the use of new features.

A feature is enabled in one of the following ways:

*  The feature's `enabled` field is set to `true`.
*  Bazel or the rule owner explicitly enable it.
*  The user enables it through the `--feature` Bazel option or `features` rule
   attribute.

Features can have interdependencies, depend on command line flags, `BUILD` file
settings, and other variables.

### Feature relationships {:#feature-relationships}

Dependencies are typically managed directly with Bazel, which simply enforces
the requirements and manages conflicts intrinsic to the nature of the features
defined in the build. The toolchain specification allows for more granular
constraints for use directly within the Starlark rule that govern feature
support and expansion. These are:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Constraint</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>requires = [
   feature_set (features = [
       'feature-name-1',
       'feature-name-2'
   ]),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Feature-level. The feature is supported only if the specified required
       features are enabled. For example, when a feature is only supported in
       certain build modes (<code>opt</code>, <code>dbg</code>, or
       <code>fastbuild</code>). If `requires` contains multiple `feature_set`s
       the feature is supported if any of the `feature_set`s is satisfied
       (when all specified features are enabled).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>implies = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. This feature implies the specified feature(s).
       Enabling a feature also implicitly enables all features implied by it
       (that is, it functions recursively).</p>
       <p>Also provides the ability to factor common subsets of functionality out of
       a set of features, such as the common parts of sanitizers. Implied
       features cannot be disabled.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>provides = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. Indicates that this feature is one of several mutually
       exclusive alternate features. For example, all of the sanitizers could
       specify <code>provides = ["sanitizer"]</code>.</p>
       <p>This improves error handling by listing the alternatives if the user asks
       for two or more mutually exclusive features at once.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>with_features = [
  with_feature_set(
    features = ['feature-1'],
    not_features = ['feature-2'],
  ),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Flag set-level. A feature can specify multiple flag sets with multiple.
     When <code>with_features</code> is specified, the flag set will only expand
     to the build command if there is at least one <code>with_feature_set</code>
     for which all of the features in the specified <code>features</code> set
     are enabled, and all the features specified in <code>not_features</code>
     set are disabled.
     If <code>with_features</code> is not specified, the flag set will be
     applied unconditionally for every action specified.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Actions {:#actions}

Actions provide the flexibility to modify the circumstances under
which an action executes without assuming how the action will be run. An
`action_config` specifies the tool binary that an action invokes, while a
`feature` specifies the configuration (flags) that determine how that tool
behaves when the action is invoked.

[Features](#features) reference actions to signal which Bazel actions
they affect since actions can modify the Bazel action graph. The
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider contains actions that have flags and tools
associated with them, such as `c++-compile`. Flags are assigned to each action
by associating them with a feature.

Each action name represents a single type of action performed by Bazel, such as
compiling or linking. There is, however, a many-to-one relationship between
actions and Bazel action types, where a Bazel action type refers to a Java class
that implements an action (such as `CppCompileAction`). In particular, the
"assembler actions" and "compiler actions" in the table below are
`CppCompileAction`, while the link actions are `CppLinkAction`.

### Assembler actions {:#assembler-actions}

   <td><code>c++-link-executable</code>
   </td>
   <td>Link a final ready-to-run library.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### AR actions {:#ar-actions}

AR actions assemble object files into archive libraries (`.a` files) via `ar`
and encode some semantics into the name.

<table>
  <col width="300">

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Action</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>

  <tr>
   <td><code>c++-link-static-library</code>
   </td>
   <td>Create a static library (archive).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### LTO actions {:#lto-actions}

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Action</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>lto-backend</code>
   </td>
   <td>ThinLTO action compiling bitcodes into native objects.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>lto-index</code>
   </td>
   <td>ThinLTO action generating global index.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Using action_config {:#using-action-config}

The `action_config` is a Starlark struct that describes a Bazel
action by specifying the tool (binary) to invoke during the action and sets of
flags, defined by features. These flags apply constraints to the action's
execution.

The `action_config()` constructor has the following parameters:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Attribute</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>action_name</code>
   </td>
    <td>The Bazel action to which this action corresponds.
        Bazel uses this attribute to discover per-action tool and execution
        requirements.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>tools</code>
   </td>
   <td>The executable to invoke. The tool applied to the action will be the
       first tool in the list with a feature set that matches the feature
       configuration. Default value must be provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>flag_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of flags that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a
       feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>env_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of environment constraints that applies to a group of actions.
       Same as for a feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

An `action_config` can require and imply other features and
<code>action_config</code>s as dictated by the
[feature relationships](#feature-relationships) described earlier. This behavior
is similar to that of a feature.

The last two attributes are redundant against the corresponding attributes on
features and are included because some Bazel actions require certain flags or
environment variables and the goal is to avoid unnecessary `action_config`+`feature`
pairs. Typically, sharing a single feature across multiple `action_config`s is
preferred.

You can not define more than one `action_config` with the same `action_name`
within the same toolchain. This prevents ambiguity in tool paths
and enforces the intention behind `action_config` - that an action's properties
are clearly described in a single place in the toolchain.

### Using tool constructor {:#using-tool-constructor}

An`action_config` can specify a set of tools via its `tools` parameter.
The `tool()` constructor takes in the following parameters:


<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>path</code>
   </td>
   <td>Path to the tool in question (relative to the current location).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>with_features</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of feature sets out of which at least one must be satisfied
       for this tool to apply.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For a given `action_config`, only a single `tool` applies
its tool path and execution requirements to the Bazel action. A tool is selected
by iterating through the `tools` attribute on an `action_config` until a tool
with a `with_feature` set matching the feature configuration is found
(see [Feature relationships](#feature-relationships) earlier on this page
for more information). You should end your tool lists with a default
tool that corresponds to an empty feature configuration.

### Example usage {:#example-usage}

Features and actions can be used together to implement Bazel actions
with diverse cross-platform semantics. For example, debug symbol generation on
macOS requires generating symbols in the compile action, then invoking a
specialized tool during the link action to create  compressed dsym archive, and
then decompressing that archive to produce the application bundle and `.plist`
files consumable by Xcode.

With Bazel, this process can instead be implemented as follows, with
`unbundle-debuginfo` being a Bazel action:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            action_name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    with_features = [
                        with_feature(features=["generate-debug-symbols"]),
                    ],
                    path = "toolchain/mac/ld-with-dsym-packaging",
                ),
                tool (path = "toolchain/mac/ld"),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature(
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set (

This same feature can be implemented entirely differently for Linux, which uses
`fission`, or for Windows, which produces `.pdb` files. For example, the
implementation for `fission`-based debug symbol generation might look as
follows:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    path = "toolchain/bin/gcc",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature (
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            requires = [with_feature_set(features = ["dbg"])],
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-gsplit-dwarf"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-Wl", "--gdb-index"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
          ],
        ),
    ]


### Flag groups {:#flag-groups}

`CcToolchainConfigInfo` allows you to bundle flags into groups that serve a
specific purpose. You can specify a flag within using pre-defined variables
within the flag value, which the compiler expands when adding the flag to the
build command. For example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["%{output_execpath}"],
    )


In this case, the contents of the flag will be replaced by the output file path
of the action.

Flag groups are expanded to the build command in the order in which they appear
in the list, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

For flags that need to repeat with different values when added to the build
command, the flag group can iterate variables of type `list`. For example, the
variable `include_path` of type `list`:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I<path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list. All
flags (or `flag_group`s) in the body of a flag group declaration are expanded as
a unit. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I", "%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I <path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list.

A variable can repeat multiple times. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-iprefix=%{include_paths}", "-isystem=%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to:

    -iprefix=<inc0> -isystem=<inc0> -iprefix=<inc1> -isystem=<inc1>

Variables can correspond to structures accessible using dot-notation. For
example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.name}"],
    )

Structures can be nested and may also contain sequences. To prevent name clashes
and to be explicit, you must specify the full path through the fields. For
example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
            ),
        ],
    )


### Conditional expansion {:#conditional-expansion}

Flag groups support conditional expansion based on the presence of a particular
variable or its field using the `expand_if_available`, `expand_if_not_available`,
`expand_if_true`, `expand_if_false`, or `expand_if_equal` attributes. For example:


    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--whole_archive"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--no_whole_archive"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
        ],
    )

Note: The `--whole_archive` and `--no_whole_archive` options are added to
the build command only when a currently iterated library has an
`is_whole_archive` field.

This is a long list of features. The plan is to get rid of them once
[Crosstool in Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380){: .external} is
done. For the curious reader see the implementation in
[CppActionConfigs](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CppActionConfigs.java?q=cppactionconfigs&ss=bazel),
and for production toolchains consider adding `no_legacy_features` to make
the toolchain more standalone.

# Android Build Performance

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains information on optimizing build performance for Android
apps specifically. For general build performance optimization with Bazel, see
[Optimizing Performance](/rules/performance).

## Recommended flags {:#recommended-flags}

The flags are in the
[`bazelrc` configuration syntax](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-syntax-semantics), so
they can be pasted directly into a `bazelrc` file and invoked with
`--config=<configuration_name>` on the command line.

**Profiling performance**

Bazel writes a JSON trace profile by default to a file called
`command.profile.gz` in Bazel's output base.
See the [JSON Profile documentation](/rules/performance#performance-profiling) for
how to read and interact with the profile.

**Persistent workers for Android build actions**.

A subset of Android build actions has support for
[persistent workers](https://blog.bazel.build/2015/12/10/java-workers.html).

These actions' mnemonics are:

*   DexBuilder
*   Javac
*   Desugar
*   AaptPackage
*   AndroidResourceParser
*   AndroidResourceValidator
*   AndroidResourceCompiler
*   RClassGenerator
*   AndroidResourceLink
*   AndroidAapt2
*   AndroidAssetMerger
*   AndroidResourceMerger
*   AndroidCompiledResourceMerger

Enabling workers can result in better build performance by saving on JVM
startup costs from invoking each of these tools, but at the cost of increased
memory usage on the system by persisting them.

To enable workers for these actions, apply these flags with
`--config=android_workers` on the command line:

```
build:android_workers --strategy=DexBuilder=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Javac=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Desugar=worker

# A wrapper flag for these resource processing actions:
# - AndroidResourceParser
# - AndroidResourceValidator
# - AndroidResourceCompiler
# - RClassGenerator
# - AndroidResourceLink
# - AndroidAapt2
# - AndroidAssetMerger
# - AndroidResourceMerger
# - AndroidCompiledResourceMerger
build:android_workers --persistent_android_resource_processor
```

The default number of persistent workers created per action is `4`. We have
[measured improved build performance](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8586#issuecomment-500070549){: .external}
by capping the number of instances for each action to `1` or `2`, although this
may vary depending on the system Bazel is running on, and the project being
built.

To cap the number of instances for an action, apply these flags:

```
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=DexBuilder=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Javac=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Desugar=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=AaptPackage=2
# .. and so on for each action you're interested in.
```

**Using AAPT2**

[`aapt2`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2){: .external} has improved
performance over `aapt` and also creates smaller APKs. To use `aapt2`, use the
`--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or set `aapt2` on the `aapt_version` on
`android_binary` and `android_local_test`.

**SSD optimizations**

The `--experimental_multi_threaded_digest` flag is useful for optimizing digest
computation on SSDs.

# Commands and Options

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page covers the options that are available with various Bazel commands,
such as `bazel build`, `bazel run`, and `bazel test`. This page is a companion
to the list of Bazel's commands in [Build with Bazel](/run/build).

## Target syntax {:#target-syntax}

Some commands, like `build` or `test`, can operate on a list of targets. They
use a syntax more flexible than labels, which is documented in
[Specifying targets to build](/run/build#specifying-build-targets).

## Options {:#build-options}

The following sections describe the options available during a
build. When `--long` is used on a help command, the on-line
help messages provide summary information about the meaning, type and
default value for each option.

Most options can only be specified once. When specified multiple times, the
last instance wins. Options that can be specified multiple times are
identified in the on-line help with the text 'may be used multiple times'.

### Package location {:#package-location}

#### `--package_path` {:#package-path}

**WARNING:** The `--package_path` option is deprecated. Bazel prefers packages
in the main repository to be under the workspace root.

This option specifies the set of directories that are searched to
find the BUILD file for a given package.

Bazel finds its packages by searching the package path. This is a colon
separated ordered list of bazel directories, each being the root of a
partial source tree.

_To specify a custom package path_ using the `--package_path` option:

<pre>
  % bazel build --package_path %workspace%:/some/other/root
</pre>

Package path elements may be specified in three formats:

1.  If the first character is `/`, the path is absolute.
2.  If the path starts with `%workspace%`, the path is taken relative
    to the nearest enclosing bazel directory.
    For instance, if your working directory
    is `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, then the
    string `%workspace%` in the package-path is expanded
    to `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel`.
3.  Anything else is taken relative to the working directory.
    This is usually not what you mean to do,
    and may behave unexpectedly if you use Bazel from directories below the bazel workspace.
    For instance, if you use the package-path element `.`,
    and then cd into the directory
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo`, packages
    will be resolved from the
    `/home/bob/clients/bob_client/bazel/foo` directory.

If you use a non-default package path, specify it in your
[Bazel configuration file](/run/bazelrc) for convenience.

_Bazel doesn't require any packages to be in the
current directory_, so you can do a build from an empty bazel
workspace if all the necessary packages can be found somewhere else
on the package path.

Example: Building from an empty client

<pre>
  % mkdir -p foo/bazel
  % cd foo/bazel
  % touch MODULE.bazel
  % bazel build --package_path /some/other/path //foo
</pre>

#### `--deleted_packages` {:flag--deleted_packages}

This option specifies a comma-separated list of packages which Bazel
should consider deleted, and not attempt to load from any directory
on the package path. This can be used to simulate the deletion of packages without
actually deleting them. This option can be passed multiple times, in which case
the individual lists are concatenated.

### Error checking {:#error-checking}

These options control Bazel's error-checking and/or warnings.

#### `--[no]check_visibility` {:#check-visibility}

If this option is set to false, visibility checks are demoted to warnings.
The default value of this option is true, so that by default, visibility
checking is done.

#### `--output_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-filter}

The `--output_filter` option will only show build and compilation
warnings for targets that match the regular expression. If a target does not
match the given regular expression and its execution succeeds, its standard
output and standard error are thrown away.

Here are some typical values for this option:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//(first/project|second/project):'`</td>
    <td>Show the output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter='^//((?!(first/bad_project|second/bad_project):).)*$'`</td>
    <td>Don't show output for the specified packages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=`</td>
    <td>Show everything.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`--output_filter=DONT_MATCH_ANYTHING`</td>
    <td>Show nothing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tool flags {:#tool-flags}

These options control which options Bazel will pass to other tools.

#### `--copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler.
The argument will be passed to the compiler whenever it is invoked
for preprocessing, compiling, and/or assembling C, C++, or
assembler code. It will not be passed when linking.

This option can be used multiple times. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-g0" --copt="-fpic" //foo
</pre>

will compile the `foo` library without debug tables, generating
position-independent code.

Note: Changing `--copt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected object files. Also note that copts values listed in specific
cc_library or cc_binary build rules will be placed on the compiler command line
_after_ these options.

Warning: C++-specific options (such as `-fno-implicit-templates`)
should be specified in `--cxxopt`, not in
`--copt`. Likewise, C-specific options (such as -Wstrict-prototypes)
should be specified in `--conlyopt`, not in `copt`.
Similarly, compiler options that only have an
effect at link time (such as `-l`) should be specified in
`--linkopt`, not in `--copt`.

#### `--host_copt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-copt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--copt`](#copt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-conlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--conlyopt`](#cconlyopt) option, but applies only
to the exec configuration.

#### `--host_cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler for C++ source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--cxxopt`](#cxxopt) option, but applies only to the
exec configuration.

#### `--host_linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the linker for source files
that are compiled in the exec configuration. This is analogous to
the [`--linkopt`](#linkopt) option, but applies only to
the exec configuration.

#### `--conlyopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cconlyopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when compiling C source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C compilation,
not to C++ compilation or linking. So you can pass C-specific options
(such as `-Wno-pointer-sign`) using `--conlyopt`.

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--cxxopt={{ "<var>" }}cc-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cxxopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when
compiling C++ source files.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to C++ compilation,
not to C compilation or linking. So you can pass C++-specific options
(such as `-fpermissive` or `-fno-implicit-templates`) using `--cxxopt`.

For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --cxxopt="-fpermissive" --cxxopt="-Wno-error" //foo/cruddy_code
</pre>

Note: copts parameters listed in specific cc_library or cc_binary build rules
are placed on the compiler command line _after_ these options.

#### `--linkopt={{ "<var>" }}linker-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#linkopt}

This option takes an argument which is to be passed to the compiler when linking.

This is similar to `--copt`, but only applies to linking,
not to compilation. So you can pass compiler options that only make sense
at link time (such as `-lssp` or `-Wl,--wrap,abort`)
using `--linkopt`. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --copt="-fmudflap" --linkopt="-lmudflap" //foo/buggy_code
</pre>

Build rules can also specify link options in their attributes. This option's
settings always take precedence. Also see
[cc_library.linkopts](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.linkopts).

#### `--strip (always|never|sometimes)` {:#strip}

This option determines whether Bazel will strip debugging information from
all binaries and shared libraries, by invoking the linker with the `-Wl,--strip-debug` option.
`--strip=always` means always strip debugging information.
`--strip=never` means never strip debugging information.
The default value of `--strip=sometimes` means strip if the `--compilation_mode`
is `fastbuild`.

<pre>
  % bazel build --strip=always //foo:bar
</pre>

will compile the target while stripping debugging information from all generated
binaries.

Note: If you want debugging information, it's not enough to disable stripping;
you also need to make sure that the debugging information was generated by the
compiler, which you can do by using either `-c dbg` or `--copt -g`.

Bazel's `--strip` option corresponds with ld's `--strip-debug` option:
it only strips debugging information. If for some reason you want to strip _all_ symbols,
not just _debug_ symbols, you would need to use ld's `--strip-all` option,
which you can do by passing `--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all` to Bazel. Also be
aware that setting Bazel's `--strip` flag will override
`--linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all`, so you should only set one or the other.

If you are only building a single binary and want all symbols stripped, you could also
pass `--stripopt=--strip-all` and explicitly build the
`//foo:bar.stripped` version of the target. As described in the section on
`--stripopt`, this applies a strip action after the final binary is
linked rather than including stripping in all of the build's link actions.

#### `--stripopt={{ "<var>" }}strip-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#stripopt}

This is an additional option to pass to the `strip` command when generating
a [`*.stripped` binary](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary_implicit_outputs). The default
is `-S -p`. This option can be used multiple times.

Note: `--stripopt` does not apply to the stripping of the main
binary with `[--strip](#flag--strip)=(always|sometimes)`.

#### `--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}profile-output-dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-instrument}

The `--fdo_instrument` option enables the generation of
FDO (feedback directed optimization) profile output when the
built C/C++ binary is executed. For GCC, the argument provided is used as a
directory prefix for a per-object file directory tree of .gcda files
containing profile information for each .o file.

Once the profile data tree has been generated, the profile tree
should be zipped up, and provided to the
`--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}`
Bazel option to enable the FDO-optimized compilation.

For the LLVM compiler the argument is also the directory under which the raw LLVM profile
data file(s) is dumped. For example:
`--fdo_instrument={{ "<var>" }}/path/to/rawprof/dir/{{ "</var>" }}`.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--fdo_optimize={{ "<var>" }}profile-zip{{ "</var>" }}` {:#fdo-optimize}

The `--fdo_optimize` option enables the use of the
per-object file profile information to perform FDO (feedback
directed optimization) optimizations when compiling. For GCC, the argument
provided is the zip file containing the previously-generated file tree
of .gcda files containing profile information for each .o file.

Alternatively, the argument provided can point to an auto profile
identified by the extension .afdo.

Note: This option also accepts labels that resolve to source files. You
may need to add an `exports_files` directive to the corresponding package to
make the file visible to Bazel.

For the LLVM compiler the argument provided should point to the indexed LLVM
profile output file prepared by the llvm-profdata tool, and should have a .profdata
extension.

The options `--fdo_instrument` and `--fdo_optimize` cannot be used at the same time.

#### `--java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-language-version}

This option specifies the version of Java sources. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --java_language_version=8 java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

compiles and allows only constructs compatible with Java 8 specification.
Default value is 11. -->
Possible values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 21 and may be extended by
registering custom Java toolchains using `default_java_toolchain`.

#### `--tool_java_language_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-language-version}

The Java language version used to build tools that are executed during a build.
Default value is 11.

#### `--java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-runtime-version}

This option specifies the version of JVM to use to execute the code and run the tests. For
example:

<pre>
  % bazel run --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11 java/com/example/common/foo:java_application
</pre>

downloads JDK 11 from a remote repository and run the Java application using it.

Default value is `local_jdk`.
Possible values are: `local_jdk`, `local_jdk_{{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}`,
`remotejdk_11`, `remotejdk_17`, and `remotejdk_21`.
You can extend the values by registering custom JVM using either
`local_java_repository` or `remote_java_repository` repository rules.

#### `--tool_java_runtime_version={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#tool-java-runtime-version}

The version of JVM used to execute tools that are needed during a build.
Default value is `remotejdk_11`.

#### `--jvmopt={{ "<var>" }}jvm-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#jvmopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to the Java VM. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --jvmopt="-server -Xms256m" java/com/example/common/foo:all
</pre>

will use the server VM for launching all Java binaries and set the
startup heap size for the VM to 256 MB.

#### `--javacopt={{ "<var>" }}javac-option{{ "</var>" }}` {:#javacopt}

This option allows option arguments to be passed to javac. It can be used
with one big argument, or multiple times with individual arguments. For example:

<pre>
  % bazel build --javacopt="-g:source,lines" //myprojects:prog
</pre>

will rebuild a java_binary with the javac default debug info
(instead of the bazel default).

The option is passed to javac after the Bazel built-in default options for
javac and before the per-rule options. The last specification of
any option to javac wins. The default options for javac are:

<pre>
  -source 8 -target 8 -encoding UTF-8
</pre>

Note: Changing `--javacopt` settings will force a recompilation
of all affected classes. Also note that javacopts parameters listed in
specific java_library or java_binary build rules will be placed on the javac
command line _after_ these options.

#### `--strict_java_deps (default|strict|off|warn|error)` {:#strict-java-deps}

This option controls whether javac checks for missing direct dependencies.
Java targets must explicitly declare all directly used targets as
dependencies. This flag instructs javac to determine the jars actually used
for type checking each java file, and warn/error if they are not the output
of a direct dependency of the current target.

* `off` means checking is disabled.
* `warn` means javac will generate standard java warnings of
  type `[strict]` for each missing direct dependency.
* `default`, `strict` and `error` all
  mean javac will generate errors instead of warnings, causing the current
  target to fail to build if any missing direct dependencies are found.
  This is also the default behavior when the flag is unspecified.

### Build semantics {:#build-semantics}

These options affect the build commands and/or the output file contents.

#### `--compilation_mode (fastbuild|opt|dbg)` (-c) {:#compilation-mode}

The `--compilation_mode` option (often shortened to `-c`,
especially `-c opt`) takes an argument of `fastbuild`, `dbg`
or `opt`, and affects various C/C++ code-generation
options, such as the level of optimization and the completeness of
debug tables. Bazel uses a different output directory for each
different compilation mode, so you can switch between modes without
needing to do a full rebuild _every_ time.

* `fastbuild` means build as fast as possible:
  generate minimal debugging information (`-gmlt
  -Wl,-S`), and don't optimize. This is the
  default. Note: `-DNDEBUG` will **not** be set.
* `dbg` means build with debugging enabled (`-g`),
  so that you can use gdb (or another debugger).
* `opt` means build with optimization enabled and
  with `assert()` calls disabled (`-O2 -DNDEBUG`).
  Debugging information will not be generated in `opt` mode
  unless you also pass `--copt -g`.

#### `--cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#cpu}

This option specifies the target CPU architecture to be used for
the compilation of binaries during the build.

Note: A particular combination of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU is allowed only if it has been specified in the currently
used CROSSTOOL file.

#### `--action_env={{ "<var>" }}VAR=VALUE{{ "</var>" }}` {:#action-env}

Specifies the set of environment variables available during the execution of all actions.
Variables can be either specified by name, in which case the value will be taken from the
invocation environment, or by the `name=value` pair which sets the value independent of the
invocation environment.

This `--action_env` flag can be specified multiple times. If a value is assigned to the same
variable across multiple `--action_env` flags, the latest assignment wins.

#### `--experimental_action_listener={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-action-listener}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects)
instead.

The `experimental_action_listener` option instructs Bazel to use
details from the [`action_listener`](/reference/be/extra-actions#action_listener) rule specified by {{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }} to
insert [`extra_actions`](/reference/be/extra-actions#extra_action) into the build graph.

#### `--[no]experimental_extra_action_top_level_only` {:experimental-extra-action-top-level-only}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

If this option is set to true, extra actions specified by the
[ `--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) command
line option will only be scheduled for top level targets.

#### `--experimental_extra_action_filter={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#experimental-extra-action-filter}

Warning: Extra actions are deprecated. Use
[aspects](/extending/aspects) instead.

The `experimental_extra_action_filter` option instructs Bazel to
filter the set of targets to schedule `extra_actions` for.

This flag is only applicable in combination with the
[`--experimental_action_listener`](#experimental-action-listener) flag.

By default all `extra_actions` in the transitive closure of the
requested targets-to-build get scheduled for execution.
`--experimental_extra_action_filter` will restrict scheduling to
`extra_actions` of which the owner's label matches the specified
regular expression.

The following example will limit scheduling of `extra_actions`
to only apply to actions of which the owner's label contains '/bar/':

<pre>% bazel build --experimental_action_listener=//test:al //foo/... \
  --experimental_extra_action_filter=.*/bar/.*
</pre>

#### `--host_cpu={{ "<var>" }}cpu{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-cpu}

This option specifies the name of the CPU architecture that should be
used to build host tools.

#### `--android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}platform[,platform]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-platforms}

The platforms to build the transitive `deps` of
`android_binary` rules (specifically for native dependencies like C++). For
example, if a `cc_library` appears in the transitive `deps` of an
`android_binary` rule it is be built once for each platform specified with
`--android_platforms` for the `android_binary` rule, and included in the final
output.

There is no default value for this flag: a custom Android platform must be
defined and used.

One `.so` file is created and packaged in the APK for each platform specified
with `--android_platforms`. The `.so` file's name prefixes the name of the
`android_binary` rule with "lib". For example, if the name of the
`android_binary` is "foo", then the file is `libfoo.so`.

#### `--per_file_copt={{ "<var>" }}[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...{{ "</var>" }}` {:#per-file-copt}

When present, any C++ file with a label or an execution path matching one of the inclusion regex
expressions and not matching any of the exclusion expressions will be built
with the given options. The label matching uses the canonical form of the label
(i.e //`package`:`label_name`).

The execution path is the relative path to your workspace directory including the base name
(including extension) of the C++ file. It also includes any platform dependent prefixes.

Note: If only one of the label or the execution path matches the options will be used.

To match the generated files (such as genrule outputs)
Bazel can only use the execution path. In this case the regexp shouldn't start with '//'
since that doesn't match any execution paths. Package names can be used like this:
`--per_file_copt=base/.*\.pb\.cc@-g0`. This will match every
`.pb.cc` file under a directory called `base`.

This option can be used multiple times.

The option is applied regardless of the compilation mode used. For example, it is possible
to compile with `--compilation_mode=opt` and selectively compile some
files with stronger optimization turned on, or with optimization disabled.

**Caveat**: If some files are selectively compiled with debug symbols the symbols
might be stripped during linking. This can be prevented by setting
`--strip=never`.

**Syntax**: `[+-]regex[,[+-]regex]...@option[,option]...` Where
`regex` stands for a regular expression that can be prefixed with
a `+` to identify include patterns and with `-` to identify
exclude patterns. `option` stands for an arbitrary option that is passed
to the C++ compiler. If an option contains a `,` it has to be quoted like so
`\,`. Options can also contain `@`, since only the first
`@` is used to separate regular expressions from options.

**Example**:
`--per_file_copt=//foo:.*\.cc,-//foo:file\.cc@-O0,-fprofile-arcs`
adds the `-O0` and the `-fprofile-arcs` options to the command
line of the C++ compiler for all `.cc` files in `//foo/` except `file.cc`.

#### `--dynamic_mode={{ "<var>" }}mode{{ "</var>" }}` {:#dynamic-mode}

Determines whether C++ binaries will be linked dynamically, interacting with
the [linkstatic attribute](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) on build rules.

Modes:

* `default`: Allows bazel to choose whether to link dynamically.
  See [linkstatic](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) for more
  information.
* `fully`: Links all targets dynamically. This will speed up
  linking time, and reduce the size of the resulting binaries.
* `off`: Links all targets in
  [mostly static](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary.linkstatic) mode.
  If `-static` is set in linkopts, targets will change to fully static.

#### `--fission (yes|no|[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild])` {:#fission}

Enables [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission){: .external},
which writes C++ debug information to dedicated .dwo files instead of .o files, where it would
otherwise go. This substantially reduces the input size to links and can reduce link times.

When set to `[dbg][,opt][,fastbuild]` (example:
`--fission=dbg,fastbuild`), Fission is enabled
only for the specified set of compilation modes. This is useful for bazelrc
settings. When set to `yes`, Fission is enabled
universally. When set to `no`, Fission is disabled
universally. Default is <code class='flag'>no</code>.

#### `--force_ignore_dash_static` {:#force-ignore-dash-static}

If this flag is set, any `-static` options in linkopts of
`cc_*` rules BUILD files are ignored. This is only intended as a
workaround for C++ hardening builds.

#### `--[no]force_pic` {:#force-pic}

If enabled, all C++ compilations produce position-independent code ("-fPIC"),
links prefer PIC pre-built libraries over non-PIC libraries, and links produce
position-independent executables ("-pie"). Default is disabled.

Note: Dynamically linked binaries (for example `--dynamic_mode fully`)
generate PIC code regardless of this flag's setting. So this flag is for cases
where users want PIC code explicitly generated for static links.

#### `--android_resource_shrinking` {:#flag--android_resource_shrinking}

Selects whether to perform resource shrinking for android_binary rules. Sets the default for the
[shrink_resources attribute](/reference/be/android#android_binary.shrink_resources) on
android_binary rules; see the documentation for that rule for further details. Defaults to off.

#### `--custom_malloc={{ "<var>" }}malloc-library-target{{ "</var>" }}` {:#custom-malloc}

When specified, always use the given malloc implementation, overriding all
`malloc="target"` attributes, including in those targets that use the
default (by not specifying any `malloc`).

#### `--crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#crosstool-top}

This option specifies the location of the crosstool compiler suite
to be used for all C++ compilation during a build. Bazel will look in that
location for a CROSSTOOL file and uses that to automatically determine
settings for `--compiler`.

#### `--host_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-crosstool-top}

If not specified, Bazel uses the value of `--crosstool_top` to compile
code in the exec configuration, such as tools run during the build. The main purpose of this flag
is to enable cross-compilation.

#### `--apple_crosstool_top={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#apple-crosstool-top}

The crosstool to use for compiling C/C++ rules in the transitive `deps` of
objc_*, ios__*, and apple_* rules. For those targets, this flag overwrites
`--crosstool_top`.

#### `--compiler={{ "<var>" }}version{{ "</var>" }}` {:#compiler}

This option specifies the C/C++ compiler version (such as `gcc-4.1.0`)
to be used for the compilation of binaries during the build. If you want to
build with a custom crosstool, you should use a CROSSTOOL file instead of
specifying this flag.

Note: Only certain combinations of crosstool version, compiler version,
and target CPU are allowed.

#### `--android_sdk={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#android-sdk}

Deprecated. This shouldn't be directly specified.

This option specifies the Android SDK/platform toolchain
and Android runtime library that will be used to build any Android-related
rule.

The Android SDK will be automatically selected if an `android_sdk_repository`
rule is defined in the WORKSPACE file.

#### `--java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_java_toolchain={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-java-toolchain}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--javabase=({{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }})` {:#javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

#### `--host_javabase={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-javabase}

No-op. Kept only for backwards compatibility.

### Execution strategy {:#execution-strategy}

These options affect how Bazel will execute the build.
They should not have any significant effect on the output files
generated by the build. Typically their main effect is on the
speed of the build.

#### `--spawn_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#spawn-strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed.

* `standalone` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is
  deprecated. Please use `local` instead.
* `sandboxed` causes commands to be executed inside a sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that all input files, data dependencies and tools are listed as direct
  dependencies in the `srcs`, `data` and `tools` attributes.
  Bazel enables local sandboxing by default, on systems that support sandboxed execution.
* `local` causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses.
* `worker` causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.
* `docker` causes commands to be executed inside a docker sandbox on the local machine.
  This requires that docker is installed.
* `remote` causes commands to be executed remotely; this is only available if a
  remote executor has been configured separately.

#### `--strategy {{ "<var>" }}mnemonic{{ "</var>" }}={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy}

This option controls where and how commands are executed, overriding the
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) (and
[--genrule_strategy](#genrule-strategy) with mnemonic
Genrule) on a per-mnemonic basis. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

#### `--strategy_regexp={{ "<var>" }}<filter,filter,...>=<strategy>{{ "</var>" }}` {:#strategy-regexp}

This option specifies which strategy should be used to execute commands that have descriptions
matching a certain `regex_filter`. See
[--per_file_copt](#per-file-copt) for details on
regex_filter matching. See
[--spawn_strategy](#spawn-strategy) for the supported
strategies and their effects.

The last `regex_filter` that matches the description is used. This option overrides
other flags for specifying strategy.

* Example: `--strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local` means to run actions using
  `local` strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
* Example:
  `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local' --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed`
  runs 'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `sandboxed` strategy, but reversing
  the order runs it with `local`.
* Example: `--strategy_regexp='Compiling.*/bar=local,sandboxed'` runs
  'Compiling //foo/bar/baz' with the `local` strategy and falls back to
  `sandboxed` if it fails.

#### `--genrule_strategy={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}` {:#genrule-strategy}

This is a deprecated short-hand for `--strategy=Genrule={{ "<var>" }}strategy{{ "</var>" }}`.

#### `--jobs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` (-j) {:#jobs}

This option, which takes an integer argument, specifies a limit on
the number of jobs that should be executed concurrently during the
execution phase of the build.

Note : The number of concurrent jobs that Bazel will run
is determined not only by the `--jobs` setting, but also
by Bazel's scheduler, which tries to avoid running concurrent jobs
that will use up more resources (RAM or CPU) than are available,
based on some (very crude) estimates of the resource consumption
of each job. The behavior of the scheduler can be controlled by
the `--local_ram_resources` option.

#### `--progress_report_interval={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:progress-report-interval}

Bazel periodically prints a progress report on jobs that are not
finished yet (such as long running tests). This option sets the
reporting frequency, progress will be printed every `n`
seconds.

The default is 0, that means an incremental algorithm: the first
report will be printed after 10 seconds, then 30 seconds and after
that progress is reported once every minute.

When bazel is using cursor control, as specified by
[`--curses`](#curses), progress is reported every second.

#### `--local_{ram,cpu}_resources {{ "<var>" }}resources or resource expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#local-resources}

These options specify the amount of local resources (RAM in MB and number of CPU logical cores)
that Bazel can take into consideration when scheduling build and test activities to run locally. They take
an integer, or a keyword (HOST_RAM or HOST_CPUS) optionally followed by `[-|*`float`]`
(for example, `--local_cpu_resources=2`, `--local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*.5`,
`--local_cpu_resources=HOST_CPUS-1`).
The flags are independent; one or both may be set. By default, Bazel estimates
the amount of RAM and number of CPU cores directly from the local system's configuration.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_links` {:#build-runfile-links}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether the runfiles
symlinks for tests and binaries should be built in the output directory.
Using `--nobuild_runfile_links` can be useful
to validate if all targets compile without incurring the overhead
for building the runfiles trees.

When tests (or applications) are executed, their run-time data
dependencies are gathered together in one place. Within Bazel's
output tree, this "runfiles" tree is typically rooted as a sibling of
the corresponding binary or test.
During test execution, runfiles may be accessed using paths of the form
`$TEST_SRCDIR/{{ "<var>" }}canonical_repo_name{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}packagename{{ "</var>" }}/{{ "<var>" }}filename{{ "</var>" }}`.
The runfiles tree ensures that tests have access to all the files
upon which they have a declared dependence, and nothing more. By
default, the runfiles tree is implemented by constructing a set of
symbolic links to the required files. As the set of links grows, so
does the cost of this operation, and for some large builds it can
contribute significantly to overall build time, particularly because
each individual test (or application) requires its own runfiles tree.

#### `--[no]build_runfile_manifests` {:#build-runfile-manifests}

This option, which is enabled by default, specifies whether runfiles manifests
should be written to the output tree.
Disabling it implies `--nobuild_runfile_links`.

It can be disabled when executing tests remotely, as runfiles trees will
be created remotely from in-memory manifests.

#### `--[no]discard_analysis_cache` {:#discard-analysis-cache}

When this option is enabled, Bazel will discard the analysis cache
right before execution starts, thus freeing up additional memory
(around 10%) for the [execution phase](/run/build#execution).
The drawback is that further incremental builds will be slower. See also
[memory-saving mode](/configure/memory).

#### `--[no]keep_going`  (-k) {:#keep-going}

As in GNU Make, the execution phase of a build stops when the first
error is encountered. Sometimes it is useful to try to build as
much as possible even in the face of errors. This option enables
that behavior, and when it is specified, the build will attempt to
build every target whose prerequisites were successfully built, but
will ignore errors.

While this option is usually associated with the execution phase of
a build, it also affects the analysis phase: if several targets are
specified in a build command, but only some of them can be
successfully analyzed, the build will stop with an error
unless `--keep_going` is specified, in which case the
build will proceed to the execution phase, but only for the targets
that were successfully analyzed.

#### `--[no]use_ijars` {:#use-ijars}

This option changes the way `java_library` targets are
compiled by Bazel. Instead of using the output of a
`java_library` for compiling dependent
`java_library` targets, Bazel will create interface jars
that contain only the signatures of non-private members (public,
protected, and default (package) access methods and fields) and use
the interface jars to compile the dependent targets. This makes it
possible to avoid recompilation when changes are only made to
method bodies or private members of a class.

Note: Using `--use_ijars` might give you a different
error message when you are accidentally referring to a non visible
member of another class: Instead of getting an error that the member
is not visible you will get an error that the member does not exist.
Changing the `--use_ijars` setting will force a recompilation of all affected
classes.

#### `--[no]interface_shared_objects` {:#interface-shared-objects}

This option enables _interface shared objects_, which makes binaries and
other shared libraries depend on the _interface_ of a shared object,
rather than its implementation. When only the implementation changes, Bazel
can avoid rebuilding targets that depend on the changed shared library
unnecessarily.

### Output selection {:#output-selection}

These options determine what to build or test.

#### `--[no]build` {:#build}

This option causes the execution phase of the build to occur; it is
on by default. When it is switched off, the execution phase is
skipped, and only the first two phases, loading and analysis, occur.

This option can be useful for validating BUILD files and detecting
errors in the inputs, without actually building anything.

#### `--[no]build_tests_only` {:#build-tests-only}

If specified, Bazel will build only what is necessary to run the `*_test`
and `test_suite` rules that were not filtered due to their
[size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters).
If specified, Bazel will ignore other targets specified on the command line.
By default, this option is disabled and Bazel will build everything
requested, including `*_test` and `test_suite` rules that are filtered out from
testing. This is useful because running
`bazel test --build_tests_only foo/...` may not detect all build
breakages in the `foo` tree.

#### `--[no]check_up_to_date` {:#check-up-to-date}

This option causes Bazel not to perform a build, but merely check
whether all specified targets are up-to-date. If so, the build
completes successfully, as usual. However, if any files are out of
date, instead of being built, an error is reported and the build
fails. This option may be useful to determine whether a build has
been performed more recently than a source edit (for example, for pre-submit
checks) without incurring the cost of a build.

See also [`--check_tests_up_to_date`](#check-tests-up-to-date).

#### `--[no]compile_one_dependency` {:#compile-one-dependency}

Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This is useful for
syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding a single
target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all
non-flag arguments are interpreted: each argument must be a
file target label or a plain filename relative to the current working
directory, and one rule that depends on each source filename is built. For
C++ and Java
sources, rules in the same language space are preferentially chosen. For
multiple rules with the same preference, the one that appears first in the
BUILD file is chosen. An explicitly named target pattern which does not
reference a source file results in an error.

#### `--save_temps` {:#save-temps}

The `--save_temps` option causes temporary outputs from the compiler to be
saved. These include .s files (assembler code), .i (preprocessed C) and .ii
(preprocessed C++) files. These outputs are often useful for debugging. Temps will only be
generated for the set of targets specified on the command line.

Note: The implementation of `--save_temps` does not use the compiler's
`-save-temps` flag. Instead, there are two passes, one with `-S`
and one with `-E`. A consequence of this is that if your build fails,
Bazel may not yet have produced the ".i" or ".ii" and ".s" files.
If you're trying to use `--save_temps` to debug a failed compilation,
you may need to also use `--keep_going` so that Bazel will still try to
produce the preprocessed files after the compilation fails.

The `--save_temps` flag currently works only for cc_* rules.

To ensure that Bazel prints the location of the additional output files, check that
your [`--show_result {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}`](#show-result)
setting is high enough.

#### `--build_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#build-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will build only targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Build tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

When running tests, Bazel ignores `--build_tag_filters` for test targets,
which are built and run even if they do not match this filter. To avoid building them, filter
test targets using `--test_tag_filters` or by explicitly excluding them.

#### `--test_size_filters={{ "<var>" }}size[,size]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-size-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given size. Test size filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test size values (small,
medium, large or enormous), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test sizes. For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=small,medium //foo:all
</pre>

and

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_size_filters=-large,-enormous //foo:all
</pre>

will test only small and medium tests inside //foo.

By default, test size filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_timeout_filters={{ "<var>" }}timeout[,timeout]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets with the given timeout. Test timeout filter
is specified as comma delimited list of allowed test timeout values (short,
moderate, long or eternal), optionally preceded with '-' sign used to denote
excluded test timeouts. See [--test_size_filters](#test-size-filters)
for example syntax.

By default, test timeout filtering is not applied.

#### `--test_tag_filters={{ "<var>" }}tag[,tag]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tag-filters}

If specified, Bazel will test (or build if `--build_tests_only`
is also specified) only test targets that have at least one required tag
(if any of them are specified) and does not have any excluded tags. Test tag
filter is specified as comma delimited list of tag keywords, optionally
preceded with '-' sign used to denote excluded tags. Required tags may also
have a preceding '+' sign.

For example,

<pre>
  % bazel test --test_tag_filters=performance,stress,-flaky //myproject:all
</pre>

will test targets that are tagged with either `performance` or
`stress` tag but are **not** tagged with the `flaky` tag.

By default, test tag filtering is not applied. Note that you can also filter
on test's `size` and `local` tags in
this manner.

#### `--test_lang_filters={{ "<var>" }}string[,string]*{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-lang-filters}

Specifies a comma-separated list of strings referring to names of test rule
classes. To refer to the rule class `foo_test`, use the string "foo". Bazel will
test (or build if `--build_tests_only` is also specified) only
targets of the referenced rule classes. To instead exclude those targets, use
the string "-foo". For example,

</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=foo,bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test only targets that are instances of `foo_test` or `bar_test` in
  `//baz/...`, while
</p>
<pre>
  % bazel test --test_lang_filters=-foo,-bar //baz/...
</pre>
<p>
  will test all the targets in `//baz/...` except for the `foo_test` and
  `bar_test` instances.
</p>

Tip: You can use `bazel query --output=label_kind "//p:t"` to
learn the rule class name of the target `//p:t`. And you can
look at the pair of instantiation stacks in the output of
`bazel query --output=build "//p:t"` to learn why that target
is an instance of that rule class.

Warning: The option name "--test_lang_filter" is vestigal and is therefore
unfortunately misleading; don't make assumptions about the semantics based on
the name.

#### `--test_filter={{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-filter}

Specifies a filter that the test runner may use to pick a subset of tests for
running. All targets specified in the invocation are built, but depending on
the expression only some of them may be executed; in some cases, only certain
test methods are run.

The particular interpretation of {{ "<var>" }}filter-expression{{ "</var>" }} is up to
the test framework responsible for running the test. It may be a glob,
substring, or regexp. `--test_filter` is a convenience
over passing different `--test_arg` filter arguments,
but not all frameworks support it.

### Verbosity {:#verbosity}

These options control the verbosity of Bazel's output,
either to the terminal, or to additional log files.

#### `--explain={{ "<var>" }}logfile{{ "</var>" }}` {:#explain}

This option, which requires a filename argument, causes the
dependency checker in `bazel build`'s execution phase to
explain, for each build step, either why it is being executed, or
that it is up-to-date. The explanation is written
to _logfile_.

If you are encountering unexpected rebuilds, this option can help to
understand the reason. Add it to your `.bazelrc` so that
logging occurs for all subsequent builds, and then inspect the log
when you see an execution step executed unexpectedly. This option
may carry a small performance penalty, so you might want to remove
it when it is no longer needed.

#### `--verbose_explanations` {:#verbose-explanations}

This option increases the verbosity of the explanations generated
when the [--explain](#explain) option is enabled.

In particular, if verbose explanations are enabled,
and an output file is rebuilt because the command used to
build it has changed, then the output in the explanation file will
include the full details of the new command (at least for most
commands).

Using this option may significantly increase the length of the
generated explanation file and the performance penalty of using
`--explain`.

If `--explain` is not enabled, then
`--verbose_explanations` has no effect.

#### `--profile={{ "<var>" }}file{{ "</var>" }}` {:#profile}

This option, which takes a filename argument, causes Bazel to write
profiling data into a file. The data then can be analyzed or parsed using the
`bazel analyze-profile` command. The Build profile can be useful in
understanding where Bazel's `build` command is spending its time.

#### `--[no]show_loading_progress` {:#show-loading-progress}

This option causes Bazel to output package-loading progress
messages. If it is disabled, the messages won't be shown.

#### `--[no]show_progress` {:#show-progress}

This option causes progress messages to be displayed; it is on by
default. When disabled, progress messages are suppressed.

#### `--show_progress_rate_limit={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-progress-rate}

This option causes bazel to display at most one progress message per `n` seconds,
where {{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }} is a real number.
The default value for this option is 0.02, meaning bazel will limit the progress
messages to one per every 0.02 seconds.

#### `--show_result={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#show-result}

This option controls the printing of result information at the end
of a `bazel build` command. By default, if a single
build target was specified, Bazel prints a message stating whether
or not the target was successfully brought up-to-date, and if so,
the list of output files that the target created. If multiple
targets were specified, result information is not displayed.

While the result information may be useful for builds of a single
target or a few targets, for large builds (such as an entire top-level
project tree), this information can be overwhelming and distracting;
this option allows it to be controlled. `--show_result`
takes an integer argument, which is the maximum number of targets
for which full result information should be printed. By default,
the value is 1. Above this threshold, no result information is
shown for individual targets. Thus zero causes the result
information to be suppressed always, and a very large value causes
the result to be printed always.

Users may wish to choose a value in-between if they regularly
alternate between building a small group of targets (for example,
during the compile-edit-test cycle) and a large group of targets
(for example, when establishing a new workspace or running
regression tests). In the former case, the result information is
very useful whereas in the latter case it is less so. As with all
options, this can be specified implicitly via
the [`.bazelrc`](/run/bazelrc) file.

The files are printed so as to make it easy to copy and paste the
filename to the shell, to run built executables. The "up-to-date"
or "failed" messages for each target can be easily parsed by scripts
which drive a build.

#### `--sandbox_debug` {:#sandbox-debug}

This option causes Bazel to print extra debugging information when using sandboxing for action
execution. This option also preserves sandbox directories, so that the files visible to actions
during execution can be examined.

#### `--subcommands` (`-s`) {:#subcommands}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for each command prior to executing it.

<pre>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # //examples/cpp:hello-world [action 'Linking examples/cpp/hello-world']
  (cd /home/johndoe/.cache/bazel/_bazel_johndoe/4c084335afceb392cfbe7c31afee3a9f/bazel && \
    exec env - \
    /usr/bin/gcc -o bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world -B/usr/bin/ -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now -no-canonical-prefixes -pass-exit-codes -Wl,-S -Wl,@bazel-out/local_linux-fastbuild/bin/examples/cpp/hello-world-2.params)
</pre>

Where possible, commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax,
so that they can be easily copied and pasted to a shell command prompt.
(The surrounding parentheses are provided to protect your shell from the
`cd` and `exec` calls; be sure to copy them!)
However some commands are implemented internally within Bazel, such as
creating symlink trees. For these there's no command line to display.

`--subcommands=pretty_print` may be passed to print
the arguments of the command as a list rather than as a single line. This may
help make long command lines more readable.

See also [--verbose_failures](#verbose-failures), below.

For logging subcommands to a file in a tool-friendly format, see
[--execution_log_json_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_json_file)
and
[--execution_log_binary_file](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_binary_file).

#### `--verbose_failures` {:#verbose-failures}

This option causes Bazel's execution phase to print the full command line
for commands that failed. This can be invaluable for debugging a
failing build.

Failing commands are printed in a Bourne shell compatible syntax, suitable
for copying and pasting to a shell prompt.

### Workspace status {:#workspace-status}

Use these options to "stamp" Bazel-built binaries: to embed additional information into the
binaries, such as the source control revision or other workspace-related information. You can use
this mechanism with rules that support the `stamp` attribute, such as
`genrule`, `cc_binary`, and more.

#### `--workspace_status_command={{ "<var>" }}program{{ "</var>" }}` {:#workspace-status-command}

This flag lets you specify a binary that Bazel runs before each build. The program can report
information about the status of the workspace, such as the current source control revision.

The flag's value must be a path to a native program. On Linux/macOS this may be any executable.
On Windows this must be a native binary, typically an ".exe", ".bat", or a ".cmd" file.

The program should print zero or more key/value pairs to standard output, one entry on each line,
then exit with zero (otherwise the build fails). The key names can be anything but they may only
use upper case letters and underscores. The first space after the key name separates it from the
value. The value is the rest of the line (including additional whitespaces). Neither the key nor
the value may span multiple lines. Keys must not be duplicated.

Bazel partitions the keys into two buckets: "stable" and "volatile". (The names "stable" and
"volatile" are a bit counter-intuitive, so don't think much about them.)

Bazel then writes the key-value pairs into two files:

*   `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
    contains all keys and values where the key's name starts with `STABLE_`
*   `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
    contains the rest of the keys and their values

The contract is:

*   "stable" keys' values should change rarely, if possible. If the contents of
    `bazel-out/stable-status.txt`
      change, Bazel invalidates the actions that depend on them. In
      other words, if a stable key's value changes, Bazel will rerun stamped actions.
      Therefore the stable status should not contain things like timestamps, because they change all
      the time, and would make Bazel rerun stamped actions with each build.

    Bazel always outputs the following stable keys:
    *   `BUILD_EMBED_LABEL`: value of `--embed_label`
    *   `BUILD_HOST`: the name of the host machine that Bazel is running on
    *   `BUILD_USER`: the name of the user that Bazel is running as
*   "volatile" keys' values may change often. Bazel expects them to change all the time, like
      timestamps do, and duly updates the
    `bazel-out/volatile-status.txt`
      file. In order to avoid
      rerunning stamped actions all the time though, **Bazel pretends that the volatile file never
      changes**. In other words, if the volatile status file is the only file whose contents has
      changed, Bazel will not invalidate actions that depend on it. If other inputs of the actions
      have changed, then Bazel reruns that action, and the action will see the updated volatile
      status, but just the volatile status changing alone will not invalidate the action.

    Bazel always outputs the following volatile keys:
      *   `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: time of the build in seconds since the Unix Epoch (the value
        of `System.currentTimeMillis()` divided by a thousand)
      *   `FORMATTED_DATE`: time of the build Formatted as
        `yyyy MMM d HH mm ss EEE`(for example 2023 Jun 2 01 44 29 Fri) in UTC.

On Linux/macOS you can pass `--workspace_status_command=/bin/true` to
disable retrieving workspace status, because `true` does nothing, successfully (exits
with zero) and prints no output. On Windows you can pass the path of MSYS's `true.exe`
for the same effect.

If the workspace status command fails (exits non-zero) for any reason, the build will fail.

Example program on Linux using Git:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo "CURRENT_TIME $(date +%s)"
echo "RANDOM_HASH $(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
echo "STABLE_GIT_COMMIT $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
echo "STABLE_USER_NAME $USER"
</pre>

Pass this program's path with `--workspace_status_command`, and the stable status file
will include the STABLE lines and the volatile status file will include the rest of the lines.

#### `--[no]stamp` {:#stamp}

This option, in conjunction with the `stamp` rule attribute, controls whether to
embed build information in binaries.

Stamping can be enabled or disabled explicitly on a per-rule basis using the
`stamp` attribute. Please refer to the Build Encyclopedia for details. When
a rule sets `stamp = -1` (the default for `*_binary` rules), this option
determines whether stamping is enabled.

Bazel never stamps binaries that are built for the exec configuration,
regardless of this option or the `stamp` attribute. For rules that set `stamp =
0` (the default for `*_test` rules), stamping is disabled regardless of
`--[no]stamp`. Specifying `--stamp` does not force targets to be rebuilt if
their dependencies have not changed.

Setting `--nostamp` is generally desireable for build performance, as it
reduces input volatility and maximizes build caching.

### Platform {:#platform}

Use these options to control the host and target platforms that configure how builds work, and to
control what execution platforms and toolchains are available to Bazel rules.

Please see background information on [Platforms](/extending/platforms) and [Toolchains](/extending/toolchains).

#### `--platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platforms}

The labels of the platform rules describing the target platforms for the
current command.

#### `--host_platform={{ "<var>" }}label{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-platform}

The label of a platform rule that describes the host system.

#### `--extra_execution_platforms={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-execution-platforms}

The platforms that are available as execution platforms to run actions.
Platforms can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These
platforms will be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_execution_platforms()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_execution_platforms).
This option accepts a comma-separated list of platforms in order of priority.
If the flag is passed multiple times, the most recent overrides.

#### `--extra_toolchains={{ "<var>" }}labels{{ "</var>" }}` {:#extra-toolchains}

The toolchain rules to be considered during toolchain resolution. Toolchains
can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern. These toolchains will
be considered before those declared in MODULE.bazel files by
[register_toolchains()](/rules/lib/globals/module#register_toolchains).

#### `--toolchain_resolution_debug={{ "<var>" }}regex{{ "</var>" }}` {:#toolchain-resolution-debug}

Print debug information while finding toolchains if the toolchain type matches
the regex. Multiple regexes can be separated by commas. The regex can be
negated by using a `-` at the beginning. This might help developers
of Bazel or Starlark rules with debugging failures due to missing toolchains.

### Miscellaneous {:#miscellaneous}

#### `--flag_alias={{ "<var>" }}alias_name=target_path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flag-alias}

A convenience flag used to bind longer Starlark build settings to a shorter name. For more
details, see the
[Starlark Configurations](/extending/config#using-build-setting-aliases).

#### `--symlink_prefix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#symlink-prefix}

Changes the prefix of the generated convenience symlinks. The
default value for the symlink prefix is `bazel-` which
will create the symlinks `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`, and
`bazel-genfiles`.

If the symbolic links cannot be created for any reason, a warning is
issued but the build is still considered a success. In particular,
this allows you to build in a read-only directory or one that you have no
permission to write into. Any paths printed in informational
messages at the conclusion of a build will only use the
symlink-relative short form if the symlinks point to the expected
location; in other words, you can rely on the correctness of those
paths, even if you cannot rely on the symlinks being created.

Some common values of this option:

*   **Suppress symlink creation:**
      `--symlink_prefix=/` will cause Bazel to not
      create or update any symlinks, including the `bazel-out` and
      `bazel-<workspace>`
      symlinks. Use this option to suppress symlink creation entirely.

*   **Reduce clutter:**
      `--symlink_prefix=.bazel/` will cause Bazel to create
      symlinks called `bin` (etc) inside a hidden directory `.bazel`.

#### `--platform_suffix={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#platform-suffix}

Adds a suffix to the configuration short name, which is used to determine the
output directory. Setting this option to different values puts the files into
different directories, for example to improve cache hit rates for builds that
otherwise clobber each others output files, or to keep the output files around
for comparisons.

#### `--default_visibility={{ "<var>" }}(private|public){{ "</var>" }}` {:#default-visibility}

Temporary flag for testing bazel default visibility changes. Not intended for general use
but documented for completeness' sake.

#### `--starlark_cpu_profile=_file_` {:#starlark-cpu-profile}

This flag, whose value is the name of a file, causes Bazel to gather
statistics about CPU usage by all Starlark threads,
and write the profile, in [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof){: .external} format,
to the named file.

Use this option to help identify Starlark functions that
make loading and analysis slow due to excessive computation. For example:

<pre>
$ bazel build --nobuild --starlark_cpu_profile=/tmp/pprof.gz my/project/...
$ pprof /tmp/pprof.gz
(pprof) top

</pre>

For different views of the same data, try the `pprof` commands `svg`,
`web`, and `list`.

## Using Bazel for releases {:#bazel-for-releases}

Bazel is used both by software engineers during the development
cycle, and by release engineers when preparing binaries for deployment
to production. This section provides a list of tips for release
engineers using Bazel.

### Significant options {:#significant-options}

When using Bazel for release builds, the same issues arise as for other scripts
that perform a build. For more details, see
[Call Bazel from scripts](/run/scripts). In particular, the following options
are strongly recommended:

*   [`--bazelrc=/dev/null`](/run/bazelrc)
*   [`--nokeep_state_after_build`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--keep_state_after_build)

These options are also important:

*   [`--package_path`](#package-path)
*   [`--symlink_prefix`](#symlink-prefix):
    for managing builds for multiple configurations,
    it may be convenient to distinguish each build
    with a distinct identifier, such as "64bit" vs. "32bit". This option
    differentiates the `bazel-bin` (etc.) symlinks.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To build and run tests with bazel, type `bazel test` followed by
the name of the test targets.

By default, this command performs simultaneous build and test
activity, building all specified targets (including any non-test
targets specified on the command line) and testing
`*_test` and `test_suite` targets as soon as
their prerequisites are built, meaning that test execution is
interleaved with building. Doing so usually results in significant
speed gains.

### Options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-options}

#### `--cache_test_results=(yes|no|auto)` (`-t`) {:#cache-test-results}

If this option is set to 'auto' (the default) then Bazel will only rerun a test if any of the
following conditions applies:

*   Bazel detects changes in the test or its dependencies
*   the test is marked as `external`
*   multiple test runs were requested with `--runs_per_test`
*   the test failed.

If 'no', all tests will be executed unconditionally.

If 'yes', the caching behavior will be the same as auto
except that it may cache test failures and test runs with
`--runs_per_test`.

Note: Test results are _always_ saved in Bazel's output tree,
regardless of whether this option is enabled, so
you needn't have used `--cache_test_results` on the
prior run(s) of `bazel test` in order to get cache hits.
The option only affects whether Bazel will _use_ previously
saved results, not whether it will save results of the current run.

Users who have enabled this option by default in
their `.bazelrc` file may find the
abbreviations `-t` (on) or `-t-` (off)
convenient for overriding the default on a particular run.

#### `--check_tests_up_to_date` {:#check-tests-up-to-date}

This option tells Bazel not to run the tests, but to merely check and report
the cached test results. If there are any tests which have not been
previously built and run, or whose tests results are out-of-date (for example, because
the source code or the build options have changed), then Bazel will report
an error message ("test result is not up-to-date"), will record the test's
status as "NO STATUS" (in red, if color output is enabled), and will return
a non-zero exit code.

This option also implies
[`--check_up_to_date`](#check-up-to-date) behavior.

This option may be useful for pre-submit checks.

#### `--test_verbose_timeout_warnings` {:#test-verbose-timeout-warnings}

This option tells Bazel to explicitly warn the user if a test's timeout is
significantly longer than the test's actual execution time. While a test's
timeout should be set such that it is not flaky, a test that has a highly
over-generous timeout can hide real problems that crop up unexpectedly.

For instance, a test that normally executes in a minute or two should not have
a timeout of ETERNAL or LONG as these are much, much too generous.

This option is useful to help users decide on a good timeout value or
sanity check existing timeout values.

Note: Each test shard is allotted the timeout of the entire
`XX_test` target. Using this option does not affect a test's timeout
value, merely warns if Bazel thinks the timeout could be restricted further.

#### `--[no]test_keep_going` {:#test-keep-going}

By default, all tests are run to completion. If this flag is disabled,
however, the build is aborted on any non-passing test. Subsequent build steps
and test invocations are not run, and in-flight invocations are canceled.
Do not specify both `--notest_keep_going` and `--keep_going`.

#### `--flaky_test_attempts={{ "<var>" }}attempts{{ "</var>" }}` {:#flaky-test-attempts}

This option specifies the maximum number of times a test should be attempted
if it fails for any reason. A test that initially fails but eventually
succeeds is reported as `FLAKY` on the test summary. It is,
however, considered to be passed when it comes to identifying Bazel exit code
or total number of passed tests. Tests that fail all allowed attempts are
considered to be failed.

By default (when this option is not specified, or when it is set to
default), only a single attempt is allowed for regular tests, and
3 for test rules with the `flaky` attribute set. You can specify
an integer value to override the maximum limit of test attempts. Bazel allows
a maximum of 10 test attempts in order to prevent abuse of the system.

#### `--runs_per_test={{ "<var>" }}[regex@]number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#runs-per-test}

This option specifies the number of times each test should be executed. All
test executions are treated as separate tests (fallback functionality
will apply to each of them independently).

The status of a target with failing runs depends on the value of the
`--runs_per_test_detects_flakes` flag:

*  If absent, any failing run causes the entire test to fail.
*  If present and two runs from the same shard return PASS and FAIL, the test
   will receive a status of flaky (unless other failing runs cause it to
   fail).

If a single number is specified, all tests will run that many times.
Alternatively, a regular expression may be specified using the syntax
regex@number. This constrains the effect of `--runs_per_test` to targets
which match the regex (`--runs_per_test=^//pizza:.*@4` runs all tests
under `//pizza/` 4 times).
This form of `--runs_per_test` may be specified more than once.

#### `--[no]runs_per_test_detects_flakes` {:#run-per-test-detects-flakes}

If this option is specified (by default it is not), Bazel will detect flaky
test shards through `--runs_per_test`. If one or more runs for a single shard
fail and one or more runs for the same shard pass, the target will be
considered flaky with the flag. If unspecified, the target will report a
failing status.

#### `--test_summary={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-summary}

Specifies how the test result summary should be displayed.

*   `short` prints the results of each test along with the name of
    the file containing the test output if the test failed. This is the default
    value.
*   `terse` like `short`, but even shorter: only print
    information about tests which did not pass.
*   `detailed` prints each individual test case that failed, not
    only each test. The names of test output files are omitted.
*   `none` does not print test summary.

#### `--test_output={{ "<var>" }}output_style{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-output}

Specifies how test output should be displayed:

*   `summary` shows a summary of whether each test passed or
    failed. Also shows the output log file name for failed tests. The summary
    will be printed at the end of the build (during the build, one would see
    just simple progress messages when tests start, pass or fail).
    This is the default behavior.
*   `errors` sends combined stdout/stderr output from failed tests
    only into the stdout immediately after test is completed, ensuring that
    test output from simultaneous tests is not interleaved with each other.
    Prints a summary at the build as per summary output above.
*   `all` is similar to `errors` but prints output for
    all tests, including those which passed.
*   `streamed` streams stdout/stderr output from each test in
    real-time.

#### `--java_debug` {:#java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine of a java test to wait for a connection from a
JDWP-compliant debugger before starting the test. This option implies `--test_output=streamed`.

#### `--[no]verbose_test_summary` {:#verbose-test-summary}

By default this option is enabled, causing test times and other additional
information (such as test attempts) to be printed to the test summary. If
`--noverbose_test_summary` is specified, test summary will
include only test name, test status and cached test indicator and will
be formatted to stay within 80 characters when possible.

#### `--test_tmpdir={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-tmpdir}

Specifies temporary directory for tests executed locally. Each test will be
executed in a separate subdirectory inside this directory. The directory will
be cleaned at the beginning of the each `bazel test` command.
By default, bazel will place this directory under Bazel output base directory.

Note: This is a directory for running tests, not storing test results
(those are always stored under the `bazel-out` directory).

#### `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` OR `--test_timeout={{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }},{{ "<var>" }}seconds{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-timeout}

Overrides the timeout value for all tests by using specified number of
seconds as a new timeout value. If only one value is provided, then it will
be used for all test timeout categories.

Alternatively, four comma-separated values may be provided, specifying
individual timeouts for short, moderate, long and eternal tests (in that
order).
In either form, zero or a negative value for any of the test sizes will
be substituted by the default timeout for the given timeout categories as
defined by the page [Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia).
By default, Bazel will use these timeouts for all tests by
inferring the timeout limit from the test's size whether the size is
implicitly or explicitly set.

Tests which explicitly state their timeout category as distinct from their
size will receive the same value as if that timeout had been implicitly set by
the size tag. So a test of size 'small' which declares a 'long' timeout will
have the same effective timeout that a 'large' tests has with no explicit
timeout.

#### `--test_arg={{ "<var>" }}arg{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-arg}

Passes command-line options/flags/arguments to each test process. This
option can be used multiple times to pass several arguments. For example,
`--test_arg=--logtostderr --test_arg=--v=3`.

Note that, unlike the `bazel run` command, you can't pass test arguments
directly as in `bazel test -- target --logtostderr --v=3`. That's because
extraneous arguments passed to `bazel test` are interpreted as additional test
targets. That is, `--logtostderr` and `--v=3` would each be interpreted as a
test target. This ambiguity doesn't exist for a `bazel run` command, which only
accepts one target.

`--test_arg` can be passed to a `bazel run` command, but it's ignored unless the
target being run is a test target. (As with any other flag, if it's passed in a
`bazel run` command after a `--` token, it's not processed by Bazel but
forwarded verbatim to the executed target.)

#### `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}=_value_` OR `--test_env={{ "<var>" }}variable{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-env}

Specifies additional variables that must be injected into the test
environment for each test. If {{ "<var>" }}value{{ "</var>" }} is not specified it will be
inherited from the shell environment used to start the `bazel test`
command.

The environment can be accessed from within a test by using
`System.getenv("var")` (Java), `getenv("var")` (C or C++),

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#test-run-under}

This specifies a prefix that the test runner will insert in front
of the test command before running it. The
{{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }} is split into words using Bourne shell
tokenization rules, and then the list of words is prepended to the
command that will be executed.

If the first word is a fully-qualified label (starts with
`//`) it is built. Then the label is substituted by the
corresponding executable location that is prepended to the command
that will be executed along with the other words.

Some caveats apply:

*   The PATH used for running tests may be different than the PATH in your environment,
    so you may need to use an **absolute path** for the `--run_under`
    command (the first word in {{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}).
*   **`stdin` is not connected**, so `--run_under`
    can't be used for interactive commands.

Examples:

<pre>
        --run_under=/usr/bin/strace
        --run_under='/usr/bin/strace -c'
        --run_under=/usr/bin/valgrind
        --run_under='/usr/bin/valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20'
</pre>

#### Test selection {:#test-selection}

As documented under [Output selection options](#output-selection),
you can filter tests by [size](#test-size-filters),
[timeout](#test-timeout-filters),
[tag](#test-tag-filters), or
[language](#test-lang-filters). A convenience
[general name filter](#test-filter) can forward particular
filter args to the test runner.

#### Other options for `bazel test` {:#bazel-test-other-options}

The syntax and the remaining options are exactly like
[`bazel build`](/run/build).

## Running executables {:#running-executables}

The `bazel run` command is similar to `bazel build`, except
it is used to build _and run_ a single target. Here is a typical session
(`//java/myapp:myapp` says hello and prints out its args):

<pre>
  % bazel run java/myapp:myapp -- --arg1 --arg2
  INFO: Analyzed target //java/myapp:myapp (13 packages loaded, 27 targets configured).
  INFO: Found 1 target...
  Target //java/myapp:myapp up-to-date:
    bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp
  INFO: Elapsed time: 14.290s, Critical Path: 5.54s, ...
  INFO: Build completed successfully, 4 total actions
  INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/java/myapp/myapp &lt;args omitted&gt;
  Hello there
  $EXEC_ROOT/java/myapp/myapp
  --arg1
  --arg2
</pre>

Note: `--` is needed so that Bazel
does not interpret `--arg1` and `--arg2` as
Bazel options, but rather as part of the command line for running the binary.
Additionally, Bazel will avoid logging these arguments to the console in case
they contain sensitive information.

`bazel run` is similar, but not identical, to directly invoking
the binary built by Bazel and its behavior is different depending on whether the
binary to be invoked is a test or not.

When the binary is not a test, the current working directory will be the
runfiles tree of the binary.

When the binary is a test, the current working directory will be the exec root
and a good-faith attempt is made to replicate the environment tests are usually
run in. The emulation is not perfect, though, and tests that have multiple
shards cannot be run this way (the
`--test_sharding_strategy=disabled` command line option can be used
to work around this)

The following extra environment variables are also available to the binary:

*   `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY`: the root of the workspace where the
    build was run.
*   `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY`: the current working directory where
    Bazel was run from.
*   `BUILD_ID`: the build ID of the `bazel run` invocation. This is usually
    unique, except if Bazel was run with `--script_path` and the resulting
    script is re-used.
*   `BUILD_EXECROOT`: the execution root of the `bazel run` invocation.

These can be used, for example, to interpret file names on the command line in
a user-friendly way.

### Options for `bazel run` {:#bazel-run-options}

#### `--run_under={{ "<var>" }}command-prefix{{ "</var>" }}` {:#run-run-under}

This has the same effect as the `--run_under` option for
`bazel test` ([see above](#test-run-under)),
except that it applies to the command being run by `bazel
run` rather than to the tests being run by `bazel test`
and cannot run under label.

#### Filtering logging outputs from Bazel

When invoking a binary with `bazel run`, Bazel prints logging output from Bazel
itself and the binary under invocation. To make the logs less noisy, you can
suppress the outputs from Bazel itself with the `--ui_event_filters` and
`--noshow_progress` flags.

For example:
`bazel run --ui_event_filters=-info,-stdout,-stderr --noshow_progress //java/myapp:myapp`

### Executing tests {:#executing-tests}

`bazel run` can also execute test binaries, which has the effect of
running the test in a close approximation of the environment described at
[Writing Tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia). Note that none of the
`--test_*` arguments have an effect when running a test in this manner except
`--test_arg` .

## Cleaning build outputs {:#cleaning-build-outputs}

### The `clean` command {:#clean}

Bazel has a `clean` command, analogous to that of Make.
It deletes the output directories for all build configurations performed
by this Bazel instance, or the entire working tree created by this
Bazel instance, and resets internal caches. If executed without any
command-line options, then the output directory for all configurations
will be cleaned.

Recall that each Bazel instance is associated with a single workspace, thus the
`clean` command will delete all outputs from all builds you've done
with that Bazel instance in that workspace.

To completely remove the entire working tree created by a Bazel
instance,  you can specify the `--expunge` option. When
executed with `--expunge`, the clean command simply
removes the entire output base tree which, in addition to the build
output, contains all temp files created by Bazel. It also
stops the Bazel server after the clean, equivalent to the [`shutdown`](#shutdown) command. For example, to
clean up all disk and memory traces of a Bazel instance, you could
specify:

<pre>
  % bazel clean --expunge
</pre>

Alternatively, you can expunge in the background by using
`--expunge_async`. It is safe to invoke a Bazel command
in the same client while the asynchronous expunge continues to run.

Note: This may introduce IO contention.

The `clean` command is provided primarily as a means of
reclaiming disk space for workspaces that are no longer needed.
Bazel's incremental rebuilds may not be
perfect so `clean` can be used to recover a consistent
state when problems arise.

Bazel's design is such that these problems are fixable and
these bugs are a high priority to be fixed. If you
ever find an incorrect incremental build, file a bug report, and report bugs in the tools
rather than using `clean`.

## Querying the dependency graph {:#querying-dependency-graph}

Bazel includes a query language for asking questions about the
dependency graph used during the build. The query language is used
by two commands: query and cquery. The major difference between the
two commands is that query runs after the [loading phase](/run/build#loading)
and cquery runs after the [analysis phase](/run/build#analysis). These tools are an
invaluable aid to many software engineering tasks.

The query language is based on the idea of
algebraic operations over graphs; it is documented in detail in

[Bazel Query Reference](/query/language).
Please refer to that document for reference, for
examples, and for query-specific command-line options.

The query tool accepts several command-line
option. `--output` selects the output format.
`--[no]keep_going` (disabled by default) causes the query
tool to continue to make progress upon errors; this behavior may be
disabled if an incomplete result is not acceptable in case of errors.

The `--[no]tool_deps` option,
enabled by default, causes dependencies in non-target configurations to be included in the
dependency graph over which the query operates.

The `--[no]implicit_deps` option, enabled by default, causes
implicit dependencies to be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An
implicit dependency is one that is not explicitly specified in the BUILD file
but added by bazel.

Example: "Show the locations of the definitions (in BUILD files) of
all genrules required to build all the tests in the PEBL tree."

<pre>
  bazel query --output location 'kind(genrule, deps(kind(".*_test rule", foo/bar/pebl/...)))'
</pre>

## Querying the action graph {:#aquery}

Caution: The aquery command is still experimental and its API will change.

The `aquery` command allows you to query for actions in your build graph.
It operates on the post-analysis configured target graph and exposes
information about actions, artifacts and their relationships.

The tool accepts several command-line options.
`--output` selects the output format. The default output format
(`text`) is human-readable, use `proto` or `textproto` for
machine-readable format.
Notably, the aquery command runs on top of a regular Bazel build and inherits
the set of options available during a build.

It supports the same set of functions that is also available to traditional
`query` but `siblings`, `buildfiles` and
`tests`.

For more details, see [Action Graph Query](/query/aquery).

## Miscellaneous commands and options {:#misc-commands-options}

### `help` {:#help}

The `help` command provides on-line help. By default, it
shows a summary of available commands and help topics, as shown in
[Building with Bazel](/run/build#quickstart).
Specifying an argument displays detailed help for a particular
topic. Most topics are Bazel commands, such as `build`
or `query`, but there are some additional help topics
that do not correspond to commands.

#### `--[no]long` (`-l`) {:#long}

By default, `bazel help [{{ "<var>" }}topic{{ "</var>" }}]` prints only a
summary of the relevant options for a topic. If
the `--long` option is specified, the type, default value
and full description of each option is also printed.

### `shutdown` {:#shutdown}

Bazel server processes may be stopped by using the `shutdown`
command. This command causes the Bazel server to exit as soon as it
becomes idle (for example, after the completion of any builds or other
commands that are currently in progress). For more details, see
[Client/server implementation](/run/client-server).

Bazel servers stop themselves after an idle timeout, so this command
is rarely necessary; however, it can be useful in scripts when it is
known that no further builds will occur in a given workspace.

`shutdown` accepts one
option, `--iff_heap_size_greater_than _n_`, which
requires an integer argument (in MB). If specified, this makes the shutdown
conditional on the amount of memory already consumed. This is
useful for scripts that initiate a lot of builds, as any memory
leaks in the Bazel server could cause it to crash spuriously on
occasion; performing a conditional restart preempts this condition.

### `info` {:#info}

The `info` command prints various values associated with
the Bazel server instance, or with a specific build configuration.
(These may be used by scripts that drive a build.)

The `info` command also permits a single (optional)
argument, which is the name of one of the keys in the list below.
In this case, `bazel info {{ "<var>" }}key{{ "</var>" }}` will print only
the value for that one key. (This is especially convenient when
scripting Bazel, as it avoids the need to pipe the result
through `sed -ne /key:/s/key://p`:

#### Configuration-independent data {:#configuration-independent-data}

*   `release`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary.
*   `workspace` the absolute path to the base workspace
    directory.
*   `install_base`: the absolute path to the installation
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user. Bazel
    installs its internally required executables below this directory.

*   `output_base`: the absolute path to the base output
    directory used by this Bazel instance for the current user and
    workspace combination. Bazel puts all of its scratch and build
    output below this directory.
*   `execution_root`: the absolute path to the execution
    root directory under output_base. This directory is the root for all files
    accessible to commands executed during the build, and is the working
    directory for those commands. If the workspace directory is writable, a
    symlink named `bazel-<workspace>`
    is placed there pointing to this directory.
*   `output_path`: the absolute path to the output
    directory beneath the execution root used for all files actually
    generated as a result of build commands. If the workspace directory is
    writable, a symlink named `bazel-out` is placed there pointing
    to this directory.
*   `server_pid`: the process ID of the Bazel server
     process.
*   `server_log`: the absolute path to the Bazel server's debug log file.
    This file contains debugging information for all commands over the lifetime of the
    Bazel server, and is intended for human consumption by Bazel developers and power users.
*   `command_log`: the absolute path to the command log file;
    this contains the interleaved stdout and stderr streams of the most recent
    Bazel command. Note that running `bazel info` will overwrite the
    contents of this file, since it then becomes the most recent Bazel command.
    However, the location of the command log file will not change unless you
    change the setting of the `--output_base` or
    `--output_user_root` options.
*   `used-heap-size`,
      `committed-heap-size`,
      `max-heap-size`: reports various JVM heap size
    parameters. Respectively: memory currently used, memory currently
    guaranteed to be available to the JVM from the system, maximum
    possible allocation.
*   `gc-count`, `gc-time`: The cumulative count of
    garbage collections since the start of this Bazel server and the time spent
    to perform them. Note that these values are not reset at the start of every
    build.
*   `package_path`: A colon-separated list of paths which would be
    searched for packages by bazel. Has the same format as the
    `--package_path` build command line argument.

Example: the process ID of the Bazel server.

<pre>% bazel info server_pid
1285
</pre>

#### Configuration-specific data {:#configuration-specific-data}

These data may be affected by the configuration options passed
to `bazel info`, for
example `--cpu`, `--compilation_mode`,
etc. The `info` command accepts all
the options that control dependency
analysis, since some of these determine the location of the
output directory of a build, the choice of compiler, etc.

*   `bazel-bin`, `bazel-testlogs`,
    `bazel-genfiles`: reports the absolute path to
    the `bazel-*` directories in which programs generated by the
    build are located. This is usually, though not always, the same as
    the `bazel-*` symlinks created in the base workspace directory after a
    successful build. However, if the workspace directory is read-only,
    no `bazel-*` symlinks can be created. Scripts that use
    the value reported by `bazel info`, instead of assuming the
    existence of the symlink, will be more robust.
*   The complete
    ["Make" environment](/reference/be/make-variables). If the `--show_make_env` flag is
    specified, all variables in the current configuration's "Make" environment
    are also displayed (such as `CC`, `GLIBC_VERSION`, etc).
    These are the variables accessed using the `$(CC)`
    or `varref("CC")` syntax inside BUILD files.

Example: the C++ compiler for the current configuration.
This is the `$(CC)` variable in the "Make" environment,
so the `--show_make_env` flag is needed.

<pre>
  % bazel info --show_make_env -c opt COMPILATION_MODE
  opt
</pre>

Example: the `bazel-bin` output directory for the current
configuration. This is guaranteed to be correct even in cases where
the `bazel-bin` symlink cannot be created for some reason
(such as if you are building from a read-only directory).

<pre>% bazel info --cpu=piii bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/piii-opt/bin
% bazel info --cpu=k8 bazel-bin
/var/tmp/_bazel_johndoe/fbd0e8a34f61ce5d491e3da69d959fe6/execroot/io_bazel/bazel-out/k8-opt/bin
</pre>

### `version` and `--version` {:#version}

The version command prints version details about the built Bazel
binary, including the changelist at which it was built and the date.
These are particularly useful in determining if you have the latest
Bazel, or if you are reporting bugs. Some of the interesting values
are:

*   `changelist`: the changelist at which this version of
    Bazel was released.
*   `label`: the release label for this Bazel
    instance, or "development version" if this is not a released
    binary. Very useful when reporting bugs.

`bazel --version`, with no other args, will emit the same output as
`bazel version --gnu_format`, except without the side-effect of potentially starting
a Bazel server or unpacking the server archive. `bazel --version` can be run from
anywhere - it does not require a workspace directory.

### `mobile-install` {:#mobile-install}

The `mobile-install` command installs apps to mobile devices.
Currently only Android devices running ART are supported.

See [bazel mobile-install](/docs/mobile-install) for more information.

Note: This command does not install the same thing that
`bazel build` produces: Bazel tweaks the app so that it can be
built, installed and re-installed quickly. This should, however, be mostly
transparent to the app.

The following options are supported:

#### `--incremental` {:#incremental}

If set, Bazel tries to install the app incrementally, that is, only those
parts that have changed since the last build. This cannot update resources
referenced from `AndroidManifest.xml`, native code or Java
resources (such as those referenced by `Class.getResource()`). If these
things change, this option must be omitted. Contrary to the spirit of Bazel
and due to limitations of the Android platform, it is the
**responsibility of the user** to know when this command is good enough and
when a full install is needed.

If you are using a device with Marshmallow or later, consider the
[`--split_apks`](#split-apks) flag.

#### `--split_apks` {:#split-apks}

Whether to use split apks to install and update the application on the device.
Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later. Note that the
[`--incremental`](#incremental) flag
is not necessary when using `--split_apks`.

#### `--start_app` {:#start-app}

Starts the app in a clean state after installing. Equivalent to `--start=COLD`.

#### `--debug_app` {:#debug-app}

Waits for debugger to be attached before starting the app in a clean state after installing.
Equivalent to `--start=DEBUG`.

#### `--start=_start_type_` {:#start}

How the app should be started after installing it. Supported _start_type_s are:

*   `NO` Does not start the app. This is the default.
*   `COLD` Starts the app from a clean state after install.
*   `WARM` Preserves and restores the application state on incremental installs.
*   `DEBUG` Waits for the debugger before starting the app in a clean state after
    install.

Note: If more than one of `--start=_start_type_`, `--start_app` or
`--debug_app` is set, the last value is used.

#### `--adb={{ "<var>" }}path{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb}

Indicates the `adb` binary to be used.

The default is to use the adb in the Android SDK specified by
[`--android_sdk`](#android-sdk).

#### `--adb_arg={{ "<var>" }}serial{{ "</var>" }}` {:#adb-arg}

Extra arguments to `adb`. These come before the subcommand in the
command line and are typically used to specify which device to install to.
For example, to select the Android device or emulator to use:

<pre>% bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=deadbeef
</pre>

invokes `adb` as

<pre>
adb -s deadbeef install ...
</pre>

#### `--incremental_install_verbosity={{ "<var>" }}number{{ "</var>" }}` {:#incremental-install-verbosity}

The verbosity for incremental install. Set to 1 for debug logging to be
printed to the console.

### `dump` {:#dump}

The `dump` command prints to stdout a dump of the
internal state of the Bazel server. This command is intended
primarily for use by Bazel developers, so the output of this command
is not specified, and is subject to change.

By default, command will just print help message outlining possible
options to dump specific areas of the Bazel state. In order to dump
internal state, at least one of the options must be specified.

Following options are supported:

*   `--action_cache` dumps action cache content.
*   `--packages` dumps package cache content.
*   `--skyframe` dumps state of internal Bazel dependency graph.
*   `--rules` dumps rule summary for each rule and aspect class,
    including counts and action counts. This includes both native and Starlark rules.
    If memory tracking is enabled, then the rules' memory consumption is also printed.
*   `--skylark_memory` dumps a
    [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) compatible .gz file to the specified path.
    You must enable memory tracking for this to work.

#### Memory tracking {:#memory-tracking}

Some `dump` commands require memory tracking. To turn this on, you have to pass
startup flags to Bazel:

*   `--host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`
*   `--host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1`

The java-agent is checked into Bazel at
`third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar`, so
make sure you adjust `$BAZEL` for where you keep your Bazel repository.

Do not forget to keep passing these options to Bazel for every command or the server will
restart.

Example:

<pre>
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    build --nobuild &lt;targets&gt;

    # Dump rules
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --rules

    # Dump Starlark heap and analyze it with pprof
    % bazel --host_jvm_args=-javaagent:$BAZEL/third_party/allocation_instrumenter/java-allocation-instrumenter-3.3.4.jar \
    --host_jvm_args=-DRULE_MEMORY_TRACKER=1 \
    dump --skylark_memory=$HOME/prof.gz
    % pprof -flame $HOME/prof.gz
</pre>

### `analyze-profile` {:#analyze-profile}

The `analyze-profile` command analyzes a
[JSON trace profile](/advanced/performance/json-trace-profile) previously
gathered during a Bazel invocation.

### `canonicalize-flags` {:#canonicalize-flags}

The [`canonicalize-flags`](/reference/command-line-reference#canonicalize-flags-options)
command, which takes a list of options for a Bazel command and returns a list of
options that has the same effect. The new list of options is canonical. For example,
two lists of options with the same effect are canonicalized to the same new list.

The `--for_command` option can be used to select between different
commands. At this time, only `build` and `test` are
supported. Options that the given command does not support cause an error.

Note: A small number of options cannot be reordered, because Bazel cannot
ensure that the effect is identical. Also note that this command
_does not_ expand flags from `--config`.

As an example:

<pre>
  % bazel canonicalize-flags -- --config=any_name --test_tag_filters="-lint"
  --config=any_name
  --test_tag_filters=-lint
</pre>

### Startup options {:#startup-options}

The options described in this section affect the startup of the Java
virtual machine used by Bazel server process, and they apply to all
subsequent commands handled by that server. If there is an already
running Bazel server and the startup options do not match, it will
be restarted.

All of the options described in this section must be specified using the
`--key=value` or `--key value`
syntax. Also, these options must appear _before_ the name of the Bazel
command. Use `startup --key=value` to list these in a `.bazelrc` file.

#### `--output_base={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-base}

This option requires a path argument, which must specify a
writable directory. Bazel will use this location to write all its
output. The output base is also the key by which the client locates
the Bazel server. By changing the output base, you change the server
which will handle the command.

By default, the output base is derived from the user's login name,
and the name of the workspace directory (actually, its MD5 digest),
so a typical value looks like:
`/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`.

Note: The client uses the output base to find the Bazel server
instance, so if you specify a different output base in a Bazel
command, a different server will be found (or started) to handle the
request. It's possible to perform two concurrent builds in the same
workspace directory by varying the output base.

For example:

<pre>
 OUTPUT_BASE=/var/tmp/google/_bazel_johndoe/custom_output_base
% bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}1 build //foo  &amp;  bazel --output_base ${OUTPUT_BASE}2 build //bar
</pre>

In this command, the two Bazel commands run concurrently (because of
the shell `&amp;` operator), each using a different Bazel
server instance (because of the different output bases).
In contrast, if the default output base was used in both commands,
then both requests would be sent to the same server, which would
handle them sequentially: building `//foo` first, followed
by an incremental build of `//bar`.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--output_user_root={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#output-user-root}

Points to the root directory where output and install bases are created. The directory
must either not exist or be owned by the calling user. In the past,
this was allowed to point to a directory shared among various users
but it's not allowed any longer. This may be allowed once
[issue #11100](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11100){: .external} is addressed.

If the `--output_base` option is specified, it overrides
using `--output_user_root` to calculate the output base.

The install base location is calculated based on
`--output_user_root`, plus the MD5 identity of the Bazel embedded
binaries.

You can use the `--output_user_root` option to choose an
alternate base location for all of Bazel's output (install base and output
base) if there is a better location in your filesystem layout.

Note: We recommend you do not use an NFS or similar networked file system for the root
directory, as the higher access latency will cause noticeably slower builds.

#### `--server_javabase={{ "<var>" }}dir{{ "</var>" }}` {:#server-javabase}

Specifies the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_ runs. The value must be a path to
the directory containing a JDK or JRE. It should not be a label.
This option should appear before any Bazel command, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --server_javabase=/usr/local/buildtools/java/jdk build //foo
</pre>

This flag does _not_ affect the JVMs used by Bazel subprocesses such as applications, tests,
tools, and so on. Use build options [--javabase](#javabase) or
[--host_javabase](#host-javabase) instead.

This flag was previously named `--host_javabase` (sometimes referred to as the
'left-hand side' `--host_javabase`), but was renamed to avoid confusion with the
build flag [--host_javabase](#host-javabase) (sometimes referred to as the
'right-hand side' `--host_javabase`).

#### `--host_jvm_args={{ "<var>" }}string{{ "</var>" }}` {:#host-jvm-args}

Specifies a startup option to be passed to the Java virtual machine in which _Bazel itself_
runs. This can be used to set the stack size, for example:

<pre>
  % bazel --host_jvm_args="-Xss256K" build //foo
</pre>

This option can be used multiple times with individual arguments. Note that
setting this flag should rarely be needed. You can also pass a space-separated list of strings,
each of which will be interpreted as a separate JVM argument, but this feature will soon be
deprecated.

That this does _not_ affect any JVMs used by
subprocesses of Bazel: applications, tests, tools, and so on. To pass
JVM options to executable Java programs, whether run by `bazel
run` or on the command-line, you should use
the `--jvm_flags` argument which
all `java_binary` and `java_test` programs
support. Alternatively for tests, use `bazel test --test_arg=--jvm_flags=foo ...`.

#### `--host_jvm_debug` {:#host-java-debug}

This option causes the Java virtual machine to wait for a connection
from a JDWP-compliant debugger before
calling the main method of _Bazel itself_. This is primarily
intended for use by Bazel developers.

Note: This does _not_ affect any JVMs used by subprocesses of Bazel:
applications, tests, tools, etc.

#### `--autodetect_server_javabase` {:#autodetect-server-javabase}

This option causes Bazel to automatically search for an installed JDK on startup,
and to fall back to the installed JRE if the embedded JRE isn't available.
`--explicit_server_javabase` can be used to pick an explicit JRE to
run Bazel with.

#### `--batch` {:#batch}

Batch mode causes Bazel to not use the
[standard client/server mode](/run/client-server), but instead runs a bazel
java process for a single command, which has been used for more predictable
semantics with respect to signal handling, job control, and environment
variable inheritance, and is necessary for running bazel in a chroot jail.

Batch mode retains proper queueing semantics within the same output_base.
That is, simultaneous invocations will be processed in order, without overlap.
If a batch mode Bazel is run on a client with a running server, it first
kills the server before processing the command.

Bazel will run slower in batch mode, or with the alternatives described above.
This is because, among other things, the build file cache is memory-resident, so it is not
preserved between sequential batch invocations.
Therefore, using batch mode often makes more sense in cases where performance
is less critical, such as continuous builds.

Warning: `--batch` is sufficiently slower than standard
client/server mode. Additionally it might not support all of the features and optimizations which
are made possible by a persistent Bazel server. If you're using `--batch`
for the purpose of build isolation, you should use the command option
`--nokeep_state_after_build`, which guarantees that no incremental
in-memory state is kept between builds. In order to restart the Bazel server and JVM after a
build, please explicitly do so using the "shutdown" command.

#### `--max_idle_secs={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#max-idle-secs}

This option specifies how long, in seconds, the Bazel server process
should wait after the last client request, before it exits. The
default value is 10800 (3 hours). `--max_idle_secs=0` will cause the
Bazel server process to persist indefinitely.

Note: this flag is only read if Bazel needs
to start a new server. Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.

Note: system sleep time where a build is not running is counted as idle time.

This option may be used by scripts that invoke Bazel to ensure that
they do not leave Bazel server processes on a user's machine when they
would not be running otherwise.
For example, a presubmit script might wish to
invoke `bazel query` to ensure that a user's pending
change does not introduce unwanted dependencies. However, if the
user has not done a recent build in that workspace, it would be
undesirable for the presubmit script to start a Bazel server just
for it to remain idle for the rest of the day.
By specifying a small value of `--max_idle_secs` in the
query request, the script can ensure that _if_ it caused a new
server to start, that server will exit promptly, but if instead
there was already a server running, that server will continue to run
until it has been idle for the usual time. Of course, the existing
server's idle timer will be reset.

#### `--[no]shutdown_on_low_sys_mem` {:#shutdown-on-low-sys-mem}

If enabled and `--max_idle_secs` is set to a positive duration,
after the build server has been idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is
low on memory. Linux only.

In addition to running an idle check corresponding to max_idle_secs, the build server will
starts monitoring available system memory after the server has been idle for some time.
If the available system memory becomes critically low, the server will exit.

#### `--[no]block_for_lock` {:#block-for-lock}

If enabled, Bazel will wait for other Bazel commands holding the
server lock to complete before progressing. If disabled, Bazel will
exit in error if it cannot immediately acquire the lock and
proceed.

Developers might use this in presubmit checks to avoid long waits caused
by another Bazel command in the same client.

#### `--io_nice_level={{ "<var>" }}n{{ "</var>" }}` {:#io-nice-level}

Sets a level from 0-7 for best-effort IO scheduling. 0 is highest priority,
7 is lowest. The anticipatory scheduler may only honor up to priority 4.
Negative values are ignored.

#### `--batch_cpu_scheduling` {:#batch-cpu-scheduling}

Use `batch` CPU scheduling for Bazel. This policy is useful for
workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value.
See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. This policy may provide for better system
interactivity at the expense of Bazel throughput.

### Miscellaneous options {:#misc-options}

#### `--[no]announce_rc` {:#announce-rc}

Controls whether Bazel announces startup options and command options read from
the bazelrc files when starting up.

#### `--color (yes|no|auto)` {:#color}

This option determines whether Bazel will use colors to highlight
its output on the screen.

If this option is set to `yes`, color output is enabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, Bazel will use color output only if
the output is being sent to a terminal and the TERM environment variable
is set to a value other than `dumb`, `emacs`, or `xterm-mono`.
If this option is set to `no`, color output is disabled,
regardless of whether the output is going to a terminal and regardless
of the setting of the TERM environment variable.

#### `--config={{ "<var>" }}name{{ "</var>" }}` {:#config}

Selects additional config section from
[the rc files](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-file-locations); for the current `command`,
it also pulls in the options from `command:name` if such a section exists. Can be
specified multiple times to add flags from several config sections. Expansions can refer to other
definitions (for example, expansions can be chained).

#### `--curses (yes|no|auto)` {:#curses}

This option determines whether Bazel will use cursor controls
in its screen output. This results in less scrolling data, and a more
compact, easy-to-read stream of output from Bazel. This works well with
`--color`.

If this option is set to `yes`, use of cursor controls is enabled.
If this option is set to `no`, use of cursor controls is disabled.
If this option is set to `auto`, use of cursor controls will be
enabled under the same conditions as for `--color=auto`.

#### `--[no]show_timestamps` {:#show-timestamps}

If specified, a timestamp is added to each message generated by
Bazel specifying the time at which the message was displayed.

# Sandboxing

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This article covers sandboxing in Bazel and debugging your sandboxing
environment.

*Sandboxing* is a permission restricting strategy that isolates processes from
each other or from resources in a system. For Bazel, this means restricting file
system access.

Bazel's file system sandbox runs processes in a working directory that only
contains known inputs, such that compilers and other tools don't see source
files they should not access, unless they know the absolute paths to them.

Sandboxing doesn't hide the host environment in any way. Processes can freely
access all files on the file system. However, on platforms that support user
namespaces, processes can't modify any files outside their working directory.
This ensures that the build graph doesn't have hidden dependencies that could
affect the reproducibility of the build.

More specifically, Bazel constructs an `execroot/` directory for each action,
which acts as the action's work directory at execution time. `execroot/`
contains all input files to the action and serves as the container for any
generated outputs. Bazel then uses an operating-system-provided technique,
containers on Linux and `sandbox-exec` on macOS, to constrain the action within
`execroot/`.

## Reasons for sandboxing {:#sandboxing-reasons}

-   Without action sandboxing, Bazel doesn't know if a tool uses undeclared
    input files (files that are not explicitly listed in the dependencies of an
    action). When one of the undeclared input files changes, Bazel still
    believes that the build is up-to-date and won’t rebuild the action. This can
    result in an incorrect incremental build.

-   Incorrect reuse of cache entries creates problems during remote caching. A
    bad cache entry in a shared cache affects every developer on the project,
    and wiping the entire remote cache is not a feasible solution.

-   Sandboxing mimics the behavior of remote execution — if a build works well
    with sandboxing, it will likely also work with remote execution. By making
    remote execution upload all necessary files (including local tools), you can
    significantly reduce maintenance costs for compile clusters compared to
    having to install the tools on every machine in the cluster every time you
    want to try out a new compiler or make a change to an existing tool.

## What sandbox strategy to use {:#sandboxing-strategies}

You can choose which kind of sandboxing to use, if any, with the
[strategy flags](user-manual.html#strategy-options). Using the `sandboxed`
strategy makes Bazel pick one of the sandbox implementations listed below,
preferring an OS-specific sandbox to the less hermetic generic one.
[Persistent workers](/remote/persistent) run in a generic sandbox if you pass
the `--worker_sandboxing` flag.

The `local` (a.k.a. `standalone`) strategy does not do any kind of sandboxing.
It simply executes the action's command line with the working directory set to
the execroot of your workspace.

`processwrapper-sandbox` is a sandboxing strategy that does not require any
"advanced" features - it should work on any POSIX system out of the box. It
builds a sandbox directory consisting of symlinks that point to the original
source files, executes the action's command line with the working directory set
to this directory instead of the execroot, then moves the known output artifacts
out of the sandbox into the execroot and deletes the sandbox. This prevents the
action from accidentally using any input files that are not declared and from
littering the execroot with unknown output files.

`linux-sandbox` goes one step further and builds on top of the
`processwrapper-sandbox`. Similar to what Docker does under the hood, it uses
Linux Namespaces (User, Mount, PID, Network and IPC namespaces) to isolate the
action from the host. That is, it makes the entire filesystem read-only except
for the sandbox directory, so the action cannot accidentally modify anything on
the host filesystem. This prevents situations like a buggy test accidentally rm
-rf'ing your $HOME directory. Optionally, you can also prevent the action from
accessing the network. `linux-sandbox` uses PID namespaces to prevent the action
from seeing any other processes and to reliably kill all processes (even daemons
spawned by the action) at the end.

`darwin-sandbox` is similar, but for macOS. It uses Apple's `sandbox-exec` tool
to achieve roughly the same as the Linux sandbox.

Both the `linux-sandbox` and the `darwin-sandbox` do not work in a "nested"
scenario due to restrictions in the mechanisms provided by the operating
systems. Because Docker also uses Linux namespaces for its container magic, you
cannot easily run `linux-sandbox` inside a Docker container, unless you use
`docker run --privileged`. On macOS, you cannot run `sandbox-exec` inside a
process that's already being sandboxed. Thus, in these cases, Bazel
automatically falls back to using `processwrapper-sandbox`.

If you would rather get a build error — such as to not accidentally build with a
less strict execution strategy — explicitly modify the list of execution
strategies that Bazel tries to use (for example, `bazel build
--spawn_strategy=worker,linux-sandbox`).

Dynamic execution usually requires sandboxing for local execution. To opt out,
pass the `--experimental_local_lockfree_output` flag. Dynamic execution silently
sandboxes [persistent workers](/remote/persistent).

## Downsides to sandboxing {:#sandboxing_downsides}

-   Sandboxing incurs extra setup and teardown cost. How big this cost is
    depends on many factors, including the shape of the build and the
    performance of the host OS. For Linux, sandboxed builds are rarely more than
    a few percent slower. Setting `--reuse_sandbox_directories` can
    mitigate the setup and teardown cost.

-   Sandboxing effectively disables any cache the tool may have. You can
    mitigate this by using [persistent workers](/remote/persistent), at
    the cost of weaker sandbox guarantees.

-   [Multiplex workers](/remote/multiplex) require explicit worker support
    to be sandboxed. Workers that do not support multiplex sandboxing run as
    singleplex workers under dynamic execution, which can cost extra memory.

## Debugging {:#debugging}

Follow the strategies below to debug issues with sandboxing.

### Deactivated namespaces {:#deactivated-namespaces}

On some platforms, such as
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/){: .external}
cluster nodes or Debian, user namespaces are deactivated by default due to
security concerns. If the `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` file
exists and contains a 0, you can activate user namespaces by running:

```posix-terminal
   sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

### Rule execution failures {:#rule-failures}

The sandbox may fail to execute rules because of the system setup. If you see a
message like `namespace-sandbox.c:633: execvp(argv[0], argv): No such file or
directory`, try to deactivate the sandbox with `--strategy=Genrule=local` for
genrules, and `--spawn_strategy=local` for other rules.

### Detailed debugging for build failures {:#debugging-build-failures}

If your build failed, use `--verbose_failures` and `--sandbox_debug` to make
Bazel show the exact command it ran when your build failed, including the part
that sets up the sandbox.

Example error message:

```
ERROR: path/to/your/project/BUILD:1:1: compilation of rule
'//path/to/your/project:all' failed:

Sandboxed execution failed, which may be legitimate (such as a compiler error),
or due to missing dependencies. To enter the sandbox environment for easier
debugging, run the following command in parentheses. On command failure, a bash
shell running inside the sandbox will then automatically be spawned

namespace-sandbox failed: error executing command
  (cd /some/path && \
  exec env - \
    LANG=en_US \
    PATH=/some/path/bin:/bin:/usr/bin \
    PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/some/path \
  /some/path/namespace-sandbox @/sandbox/root/path/this-sandbox-name.params --
  /some/path/to/your/some-compiler --some-params some-target)
```

You can now inspect the generated sandbox directory and see which files Bazel
created and run the command again to see how it behaves.

Note that Bazel does not delete the sandbox directory when you use
`--sandbox_debug`. Unless you are actively debugging, you should disable
`--sandbox_debug` because it fills up your disk over time.

# Apple Apps and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel to build macOS and iOS
projects. It links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to
using Bazel to build and test for those platforms.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on macOS and iOS projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building an iOS app](/start/ios-app)
*  [Objective-C build rules](/reference/be/objective-c)
*  [General Apple rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple){: .external}
*  [Integration with Xcode](/install/ide)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your macOS and iOS projects with Xcode, follow the steps
in the migration guide to start building them with Bazel:

*  [Migrating from Xcode to Bazel](/migrate/xcode)

## Apple apps and new rules {:#apple-apps-new-rules}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios.
You do not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts)
when building your macOS and iOS projects:

*  Modules:

   *  [`apple_bitcode_mode`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_bitcode_mode)
   *  [`apple_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/apple_common)
   *  [`apple_platform`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform)
   *  [`apple_platform_type`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_platform_type)
   *  [`apple_toolchain`](/rules/lib/builtins/apple_toolchain)

*  Providers:

   *  [`ObjcProvider`](/rules/lib/providers/ObjcProvider)
   *  [`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig)

## Xcode selection {:#xcode-selection}

If your build requires Xcode, Bazel will select an appropriate version based on
the `--xcode_config` and `--xcode_version` flags. The `--xcode_config` consumes
the set of available Xcode versions and sets a default version if
`--xcode_version` is not passed. This default is overridden by the
`--xcode_version` flag, as long as it is set to an Xcode version that is
represented in the `--xcode_config` target.

If you do not pass `--xcode_config`, Bazel will use the autogenerated
[`XcodeVersionConfig`](/rules/lib/providers/XcodeVersionConfig) that represents the
Xcode versions available on your host machine. The default version is
the newest available Xcode version. This is appropriate for local execution.

If you are performing remote builds, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `versions` attribute is a list of remotely available
[`xcode_version`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version)
targets, and whose `default` attribute is one of these
[`xcode_versions`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_version).

If you are using dynamic execution, you should set `--xcode_config` to an
[`xcode_config`](/reference/be/objective-c#xcode_config)
target whose `remote_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the remotely available Xcode versions, and whose
`local_versions` attribute is an
[`available_xcodes`](/reference/be/workspace#available_xcodes)
target containing the locally available Xcode versions. For `local_versions`,
you probably want to use the autogenerated
`@local_config_xcode//:host_available_xcodes`. The default Xcode version is the
newest mutually available version, if there is one, otherwise the default of the
`local_versions` target. If you prefer to use the `local_versions` default
as the default, you can pass `--experimental_prefer_mutual_default=false`.

# Java and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with Java projects. It
links to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building
Java projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on Java projects:

*   [Tutorial: Building a Java Project](/start/java)
*   [Java rules](/reference/be/java)

## Migrating to Bazel {:#migrating-to-bazel}

If you currently build your Java projects with Maven, follow the steps in the
migration guide to start building your Maven projects with Bazel:

*   [Migrating from Maven to Bazel](/migrate/maven)

## Java versions {:#java-versions}

There are two relevant versions of Java that are set with configuration flags:

*   the version of the source files in the repository
*   the version of the Java runtime that is used to execute the code and to test
    it

### Configuring the version of the source code in your repository {:#config-source-code}

Without an additional configuration, Bazel assumes all Java source files in the
repository are written in a single Java version. To specify the version of the
sources in the repository add `build --java_language_version={ver}` to
`.bazelrc` file, where `{ver}` is for example `11`. Bazel repository owners
should set this flag so that Bazel and its users can reference the source code's
Java version number. For more details, see
[Java language version flag](/docs/user-manual#java-language-version).

### Configuring the JVM used to execute and test the code {:#config-jvm}

Bazel uses one JDK for compilation and another JVM to execute and test the code.

By default Bazel compiles the code using a JDK it downloads and it executes and
tests the code with the JVM installed on the local machine. Bazel searches for
the JVM using `JAVA_HOME` or path.

The resulting binaries are compatible with locally installed JVM in system
libraries, which means the resulting binaries depend on what is installed on the
machine.

To configure the JVM used for execution and testing use `--java_runtime_version`
flag. The default value is `local_jdk`.

### Hermetic testing and compilation {:#hermetic-testing}

To create a hermetic compile, you can use command line flag
`--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11`. The code is compiled for, executed, and
tested on the JVM downloaded from a remote repository. For more details, see
[Java runtime version flag](/docs/user-manual#java_runtime_version).

### Configuring compilation and execution of build tools in Java {:#config-build-tools-java}

There is a second pair of JDK and JVM used to build and execute tools, which are
used in the build process, but are not in the build results. That JDK and JVM
are controlled using `--tool_java_language_version` and
`--tool_java_runtime_version`. Default values are `11` and `remotejdk_11`,
respectively.

#### Compiling using locally installed JDK {:#compile-using-jdk}

Bazel by default compiles using remote JDK, because it is overriding JDK's
internals. The compilation toolchains using locally installed JDK are configured,
however not used.

To compile using locally installed JDK, that is use the compilation toolchains
for local JDK, use additional flag `--extra_toolchains=@local_jdk//:all`,
however, mind that this may not work on JDK of arbitrary vendors.

For more details, see
[configuring Java toolchains](#config-java-toolchains).

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to Java projects.

### Directory structure {:#directory-structure}

Prefer Maven's standard directory layout (sources under `src/main/java`, tests
under `src/test/java`).

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow these guidelines when creating your `BUILD` files:

*   Use one `BUILD` file per directory containing Java sources, because this
    improves build performance.

*   Every `BUILD` file should contain one `java_library` rule that looks like
    this:

    ```python
    java_library(
        name = "directory-name",
        srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
        deps = [...],
    )
    ```

*   The name of the library should be the name of the directory containing the
    `BUILD` file. This makes the label of the library shorter, that is use
    `"//package"` instead of `"//package:package"`.

*   The sources should be a non-recursive [`glob`](/reference/be/functions#glob) of
    all Java files in the directory.

*   Tests should be in a matching directory under `src/test` and depend on this
    library.

## Creating new rules for advanced Java builds {:#rules-advanced-java-builds}

**Note**: Creating new rules is for advanced build and test scenarios. You do
not need it when getting started with Bazel.

The following modules, configuration fragments, and providers will help you
[extend Bazel's capabilities](/extending/concepts) when building your Java
projects:

*   Main Java module: [`java_common`](/rules/lib/toplevel/java_common)
*   Main Java provider: [`JavaInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaInfo)
*   Configuration fragment: [`java`](/rules/lib/fragments/java)
*   Other modules:

    *   [`java_annotation_processing`](/rules/lib/builtins/java_annotation_processing)
    *   [`java_compilation_info`](/rules/lib/providers/java_compilation_info)
    *   [`java_output_jars`](/rules/lib/providers/java_output_jars)
    *   [`JavaRuntimeInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaRuntimeInfo)
    *   [`JavaToolchainInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/JavaToolchainInfo)

## Configuring the Java toolchains {:#config-java-toolchains}

Bazel uses two types of Java toolchains:
- execution, used to execute and test Java binaries, controlled with
  `--java_runtime_version` flag
- compilation, used to compile Java sources, controlled with
  `--java_language_version` flag

### Configuring additional execution toolchains {:#config-execution-toolchains}

Execution toolchain is the JVM, either local or from a repository, with some
additional information about its version, operating system, and CPU
architecture.

Java execution toolchains may added using the `local_java_repository` or
`remote_java_repository` repo rules in a module extension. Adding the rule makes
the JVM available using a flag. When multiple definitions for the same operating
system and CPU architecture are given, the first one is used.

Example configuration of local JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:local_java_repository.bzl", "local_java_repository")

local_java_repository(
  name = "additionaljdk",          # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk, --java_runtime_version=11 or --java_runtime_version=additionaljdk_11
  version = 11,                    # Optional, if not set it is autodetected
  java_home = "/usr/lib/jdk-15/",  # Path to directory containing bin/java
)
```

Example configuration of remote JVM:

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:remote_java_repository.bzl", "remote_java_repository")

remote_java_repository(
  name = "openjdk_canary_linux_arm",
  prefix = "openjdk_canary", # Can be used with --java_runtime_version=openjdk_canary_11
  version = "11",            # or --java_runtime_version=11
  target_compatible_with = [ # Specifies constraints this JVM is compatible with
    "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    "@platforms//os:linux",
  ],
  urls = ...,               # Other parameters are from http_repository rule.
  sha256 = ...,
  strip_prefix = ...
)
```

### Configuring additional compilation toolchains {:#config-compilation-toolchains}

Compilation toolchain is composed of JDK and multiple tools that Bazel uses
during the compilation and that provides additional features, such as: Error
Prone, strict Java dependencies, header compilation, Android desugaring,
coverage instrumentation, and genclass handling for IDEs.

JavaBuilder is a Bazel-bundled tool that executes compilation, and provides the
aforementioned features. Actual compilation is executed using the internal
compiler by the JDK. The JDK used for compilation is specified by `java_runtime`
attribute of the toolchain.

Bazel overrides some JDK internals. In case of JDK version > 9,
`java.compiler` and `jdk.compiler` modules are patched using JDK's flag
`--patch_module`. In case of JDK version 8, the Java compiler is patched using
`-Xbootclasspath` flag.

VanillaJavaBuilder is a second implementation of JavaBuilder,
which does not modify JDK's internal compiler and does not have any of the
additional features. VanillaJavaBuilder is not used by any of the built-in
toolchains.

In addition to JavaBuilder, Bazel uses several other tools during compilation.

The `ijar` tool processes `jar` files to remove everything except call
signatures. Resulting jars are called header jars. They are used to improve the
compilation incrementality by only recompiling downstream dependents when the
body of a function changes.

The `singlejar` tool packs together multiple `jar` files into a single one.

The `genclass` tool post-processes the output of a Java compilation, and produces
a `jar` containing only the class files for sources that were generated by
annotation processors.

The `JacocoRunner` tool runs Jacoco over instrumented files and outputs results in
LCOV format.

The `TestRunner` tool executes JUnit 4 tests in a controlled environment.

You can reconfigure the compilation by adding `default_java_toolchain` macro to
a `BUILD` file and registering it either by adding `register_toolchains` rule to
the `MODULE.bazel` file or by using
[`--extra_toolchains`](/docs/user-manual#extra-toolchains) flag.

The toolchain is only used when the `source_version` attribute matches the
value specified by `--java_language_version` flag.

Example toolchain configuration:

```python
load(
  "@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl",
  "default_java_toolchain", "DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION", "BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS", "DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS"
)

default_java_toolchain(
  name = "repository_default_toolchain",
  configuration = DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION,        # One of predefined configurations
                                                          # Other parameters are from java_toolchain rule:
  java_runtime = "@rules_java//toolchains:remote_jdk11", # JDK to use for compilation and toolchain's tools execution
  jvm_opts = BASE_JDK9_JVM_OPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional JDK options
  javacopts = DEFAULT_JAVACOPTS + ["--enable_preview"],   # Additional javac options
  source_version = "9",
)
```

which can be used using `--extra_toolchains=//:repository_default_toolchain_definition`
or by adding `register_toolchains("//:repository_default_toolchain_definition")`
to the workpace.

Predefined configurations:

-   `DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: all features, supports JDK versions >= 9
-   `VANILLA_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: no additional features, supports JDKs of
    arbitrary vendors.
-   `PREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but only use prebuilt
    tools (`ijar`, `singlejar`)
-   `NONPREBUILT_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIGURATION`: same as default, but all tools are
    built from sources (this may be useful on operating system with different
    libc)

#### Configuring JVM and Java compiler flags {:#config-jvm}

You may configure JVM and javac flags either with flags or with
 `default_java_toolchain` attributes.

The relevant flags are `--jvmopt`, `--host_jvmopt`, `--javacopt`,  and
`--host_javacopt`.

The relevant `default_java_toolchain` attributes are `javacopts`, `jvm_opts`,
`javabuilder_jvm_opts`, and `turbine_jvm_opts`.

#### Package specific Java compiler flags configuration {:#package-java-compiler-flags}

You can configure different Java compiler flags for specific source
files using `package_configuration` attribute of `default_java_toolchain`.
Please refer to the example below.

```python
load("@rules_java//toolchains:default_java_toolchain.bzl", "default_java_toolchain")

# This is a convenience macro that inherits values from Bazel's default java_toolchain
default_java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    package_configuration = [
        ":error_prone",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# This associates a set of javac flags with a set of packages
java_package_configuration(
    name = "error_prone",
    javacopts = [
        "-Xep:MissingOverride:ERROR",
    ],
    packages = ["error_prone_packages"],
)

# This is a regular package_group, which is used to specify a set of packages to apply flags to
package_group(
    name = "error_prone_packages",
    packages = [
        "//foo/...",
        "-//foo/bar/...", # this is an exclusion
    ],
)
```

#### Multiple versions of Java source code in a single repository {:#java-source-single-repo}

Bazel only supports compiling a single version of Java sources in a build.
build. This means that when building a Java test or an application, all
 dependencies are built against the same Java version.

However, separate builds may be executed using different flags.

To make the task of using different flags easier, sets of flags for a specific
version may be grouped with `.bazelrc` configs":

```python
build:java8 --java_language_version=8
build:java8 --java_runtime_version=local_jdk_8
build:java11 --java_language_version=11
build:java11 --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11
```

These configs can be used with the `--config` flag, for example
`bazel test --config=java11 //:java11_test`.

# Android Instrumentation Tests

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

![Running Android instrumentation tests in parallel](/docs/images/android_test.gif "Android instrumentation test")

**Figure 1.** Running parallel Android instrumentation tests.

[`android_instrumentation_test`](/reference/be/android#android_instrumentation_test)
allows developers to test their apps on Android emulators and devices.
It utilizes real Android framework APIs and the Android Test Library.

For hermeticity and reproducibility, Bazel creates and launches Android
emulators in a sandbox, ensuring that tests always run from a clean state. Each
test gets an isolated emulator instance, allowing tests to run in parallel
without passing states between them.

For more information on Android instrumentation tests, check out the [Android
developer
documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests.html){: .external}.

Please file issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues){: .external}.

## How it works {:#how-it-works}

When you run `bazel test` on an `android_instrumentation_test` target for the
first time, Bazel performs the following steps:

1. Builds the test APK, APK under test, and their transitive dependencies
2. Creates, boots, and caches clean emulator states
3. Starts the emulator
4. Installs the APKs
5. Runs tests utilizing the [Android Test Orchestrator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator){: .external}
6. Shuts down the emulator
7. Reports the results

In subsequent test runs, Bazel boots the emulator from the clean, cached state
created in step 2, so there are no leftover states from previous runs. Caching
emulator state also speeds up test runs.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Ensure your environment satisfies the following prerequisites:

- **Linux**. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, and 18.04.

- **Bazel 0.12.0** or later. Verify the version by running `bazel info release`.

```posix-terminal
bazel info release
```
This results in output similar to the following:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
release 4.1.0
```

- **KVM**. Bazel requires emulators to have [hardware
  acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#accel-check){: .external}
  with KVM on Linux. You can follow these
  [installation instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation){: .external}
  for Ubuntu.

To verify that KVM has the correct configuration, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install cpu-checker && kvm-ok
```

If it prints the following message, you have the correct configuration:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

- **Xvfb**. To run headless tests (for example, on CI servers), Bazel requires
  the [X virtual framebuffer](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml).

To install it, run:

```posix-terminal
apt-get install xvfb
```
Verify that `Xvfb` is installed correctly and is installed at `/usr/bin/Xvfb`
by running:

```posix-terminal
which Xvfb
```
The output is the following:

```{:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
/usr/bin/Xvfb
```

- **32-bit Libraries**. Some of the binaries used by the test infrastructure are
  32-bit, so on 64-bit machines, ensure that 32-bit binaries can be run. For
  Ubuntu, install these 32-bit libraries:

```posix-terminal
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

## Getting started {:#getting-started}

Here is a typical target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`:

![The target dependency graph on an Android instrumentation test](/docs/images/android_instrumentation_test.png "Target dependency graph")

**Figure 2.** Target dependency graph of an `android_instrumentation_test`.


### BUILD file {:#build-file}

The graph translates into a `BUILD` file like this:

```python
android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test",
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86",
)

# Test app and library
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = ":my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidTestManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_test_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_test_lib",
    srcs = glob(["javatest/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        ":my_app_lib",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
    ],
    # ...
)

# Target app and library under test
android_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [":my_app_lib"],
    # ...
)

android_library(
    name = "my_app_lib",
    srcs = glob(["java/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@maven//:androidx_appcompat_appcompat",
        "@maven//:androidx_annotation_annotation",
    ]
    # ...
)
```

The main attributes of the rule `android_instrumentation_test` are:

- `test_app`: An `android_binary` target. This target contains test code and
  dependencies like Espresso and UIAutomator. The selected `android_binary`
  target is required to specify an `instruments` attribute pointing to another
  `android_binary`, which is the app under test.

- `target_device`: An `android_device` target. This target describes the
  specifications of the Android emulator which Bazel uses to create, launch and
  run the tests. See the [section on choosing an Android
  device](#android-device-target) for more information.

The test app's `AndroidManifest.xml` must include [an `<instrumentation>`
tag](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/#configure_instrumentation_manifest_settings){: .external}.
This tag must specify the attributes for the **package of the target app** and
the **fully qualified class name of the instrumentation test runner**,
`androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`.

Here is an example `AndroidTestManifest.xml` for the test app:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="com.example.android.app.test"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">

    <instrumentation
        android:name="androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        android:targetPackage="com.example.android.app" />

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="16"
        android:targetSdkVersion="27" />

    <application >
       <!-- ... -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### WORKSPACE dependencies {:#workspace-dependencies}

In order to use this rule, your project needs to depend on these external
repositories:

- `@androidsdk`: The Android SDK. Download this through Android Studio.

- `@android_test_support`: Hosts the test runner, emulator launcher, and
  `android_device` targets. You can find the [latest release
  here](https://github.com/android/android-test/releases){: .external}.

Enable these dependencies by adding the following lines to your `WORKSPACE`
file:

```python
# Android SDK
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # or set ANDROID_HOME
)

# Android Test Support
ATS_COMMIT = "$COMMIT_HASH"
http_archive(
    name = "android_test_support",
    strip_prefix = "android-test-%s" % ATS_COMMIT,
    urls = ["https://github.com/android/android-test/archive/%s.tar.gz" % ATS_COMMIT],
)
load("@android_test_support//:repo.bzl", "android_test_repositories")
android_test_repositories()
```

## Maven dependencies {:#maven-dependencies}

For managing dependencies on Maven artifacts from repositories, such as [Google
Maven](https://maven.google.com){: .external} or [Maven Central](https://central.maven.org){: .external},
you should use a Maven resolver, such as
[`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external){: .external}.

The rest of this page shows how to use `rules_jvm_external` to
resolve and fetch dependencies from Maven repositories.

## Choosing an android_device target {:#android-device-target}

`android_instrumentation_test.target_device` specifies which Android device to
run the tests on. These `android_device` targets are defined in
[`@android_test_support`](https://github.com/google/android-testing-support-library/tree/master/tools/android/emulated_devices){: .external}.

For example, you can query for the sources for a particular target by running:

```posix-terminal
bazel query --output=build @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86
```
Which results in output that looks similar to:

```python
# .../external/android_test_support/tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43:1
android_device(
  name = "android_23_x86",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
  tags = ["requires-kvm"],
  generator_name = "generic_phone",
  generator_function = "make_device",
  generator_location = "tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone/BUILD:43",
  vertical_resolution = 800,
  horizontal_resolution = 480,
  ram = 2048,
  screen_density = 240,
  cache = 32,
  vm_heap = 256,
  system_image = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_23_x86_images",
  default_properties = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:_android_23_x86_props",
)
```

The device target names use this template:

```
@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/{{ "<var>" }}device_type{{ "</var>" }}:{{ "<var>" }}system{{ "</var>" }}_{{ "<var>" }}api_level{{ "</var>" }}_x86_qemu2
```

In order to launch an `android_device`, the `system_image` for the selected API
level is required. To download the system image, use Android SDK's
`tools/bin/sdkmanager`. For example, to download the system image for
`generic_phone:android_23_x86`, run `$sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager
"system-images;android-23;default;x86"`.

To see the full list of supported `android_device` targets in
`@android_test_support`, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel query 'filter("x86_qemu2$", kind(android_device, @android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/...:*))'
```

Bazel currently supports x86-based emulators only. For better performance, use
`QEMU2` `android_device` targets instead of `QEMU` ones.

## Running tests {:#running-tests}

To run tests, add these lines to your project's
`{{ '<var>' }}project root{{ '</var>' }}:{{ '<var>' }}/.bazelrc` file.

```
# Configurations for testing with Bazel
# Select a configuration by running
# `bazel test //my:target --config={headless, gui, local_device}`

# Headless instrumentation tests (No GUI)
test:headless --test_arg=--enable_display=false

# Graphical instrumentation tests. Ensure that $DISPLAY is set.
test:gui --test_env=DISPLAY
test:gui --test_arg=--enable_display=true

# Testing with a local emulator or device. Ensure that `adb devices` lists the
# device.
# Run tests serially.
test:local_device --test_strategy=exclusive
# Use the local device broker type, as opposed to WRAPPED_EMULATOR.
test:local_device --test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER
# Uncomment and set $device_id if there is more than one connected device.
# test:local_device --test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id
```

Then, use one of the configurations to run tests:

- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=gui`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=headless`
- `bazel test //my/test:target --config=local_device`

Use __only one configuration__ or tests will fail.

### Headless testing {:#headless-testing}

With `Xvfb`, it is possible to test with emulators without the graphical
interface, also known as headless testing. To disable the graphical interface
when running tests, pass the test argument `--enable_display=false` to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=false
```

### GUI testing {:#gui-testing}

If the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set, it's possible to enable the
graphical interface of the emulator while the test is running. To do this, pass
these test arguments to Bazel:

```posix-terminal
bazel test //my/test:target --test_arg=--enable_display=true --test_env=DISPLAY
```

### Testing with a local emulator or device {:#testing-local-emulator}

Bazel also supports testing directly on a locally launched emulator or connected
device. Pass the flags
`--test_strategy=exclusive` and
`--test_arg=--device_broker_type=LOCAL_ADB_SERVER` to enable local testing mode.
If there is more than one connected device, pass the flag
`--test_arg=--device_serial_number=$device_id` where `$device_id` is the id of
the device/emulator listed in `adb devices`.

## Sample projects {:#sample-projects}

If you are looking for canonical project samples, see the [Android testing
samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing#experimental-bazel-support){: .external}
for projects using Espresso and UIAutomator.

## Espresso setup {:#espresso-setup}

If you write UI tests with [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/){: .external}
(`androidx.test.espresso`), you can use the following snippets to set up your
Bazel workspace with the list of commonly used Espresso artifacts and their
dependencies:

```
androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core
androidx.test:rules
androidx.test:runner
javax.inject:javax.inject
org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest
junit:junit
```

One way to organize these dependencies is to create a `//:test_deps` shared
library in your `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/BUILD.bazel` file:

```python
java_library(
    name = "test_deps",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    exports = [
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_rules",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_runner",
        "@maven//:javax_inject_javax_inject"
        "@maven//:org_hamcrest_java_hamcrest",
        "@maven//:junit_junit",
    ],
)
```

Then, add the required dependencies in `{{ "<var>" }}project root{{ "</var>" }}/WORKSPACE`:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "2.8"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "79c9850690d7614ecdb72d68394f994fef7534b292c4867ce5e7dec0aa7bdfad"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/%s.zip" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
)

load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "junit:junit:4.12",
        "javax.inject:javax.inject:1",
        "org.hamcrest:java-hamcrest:2.0.0.0"
        "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1",
        "androidx.test:rules:aar:1.1.1",
        "androidx.test:runner:aar:1.1.1",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://maven.google.com",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
)
```

Finally, in your test `android_binary` target, add the `//:test_deps`
dependency:

```python
android_binary(
    name = "my_test_app",
    instruments = "//path/to:app",
    deps = [
        "//:test_deps",
        # ...
    ],
    # ...
)
```

## Tips {:#tips}

### Reading test logs {:#reading-test-logs}

Use `--test_output=errors` to print logs for failing tests, or
`--test_output=all` to print all test output. If you're looking for an
individual test log, go to
`$PROJECT_ROOT/bazel-testlogs/path/to/InstrumentationTestTargetName`.

For example, the test logs for `BasicSample` canonical project are in
`bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest`, run:

```posix-terminal
tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest
```
This results in the following output:

```none

$ tree bazel-testlogs/ui/espresso/BasicSample/BasicSampleInstrumentationTest

### Reading emulator logs {:#reading-emulator-logs}

The emulator logs for `android_device` targets are stored in the `/tmp/`
directory with the name `emulator_xxxxx.log`, where `xxxxx` is a
randomly-generated sequence of characters.

Use this command to find the latest emulator log:

```posix-terminal
ls -1t /tmp/emulator_*.log | head -n 1
```

### Testing against multiple API levels {:#testing-multiple-apis}

If you would like to test against multiple API levels, you can use a list
comprehension to create test targets for each API level. For example:

```python
API_LEVELS = [
    "19",
    "20",
    "21",
    "22",
]

[android_instrumentation_test(
    name = "my_test_%s" % API_LEVEL,
    test_app = ":my_test_app",
    target_device = "@android_test_support//tools/android/emulated_devices/generic_phone:android_%s_x86_qemu2" % API_LEVEL,
) for API_LEVEL in API_LEVELS]
```

## Known issues {:#known-issues}

- [Forked adb server processes are not terminated after
  tests](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4853){: .external}
- While APK building works on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), testing
  only works on Linux.
- Even with `--config=local_adb`, users still need to specify
  `android_instrumentation_test.target_device`.
- If using a local device or emulator, Bazel does not uninstall the APKs after
  the test. Clean the packages by running this command:

```posix-terminal
adb shell pm list
packages com.example.android.testing | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '\r' | xargs
-L1 -t adb uninstall
```

# C++ and Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains resources that help you use Bazel with C++ projects. It links
to a tutorial, build rules, and other information specific to building C++
projects with Bazel.

## Working with Bazel {:#working-with-bazel}

The following resources will help you work with Bazel on C++ projects:

*  [Tutorial: Building a C++ project](/start/cpp)
*  [C++ common use cases](/tutorials/cpp-use-cases)
*  [C/C++ rules](/reference/be/c-cpp)
*  Essential Libraries
   -  [Abseil](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/quickstart){: .external}
   -  [Boost](https://github.com/nelhage/rules_boost){: .external}
   -  [HTTPS Requests: CPR and libcurl](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-make-cc-https-easy){: .external}
*  [C++ toolchain configuration](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference)
*  [Tutorial: Configuring C++ toolchains](/tutorials/ccp-toolchain-config)
*  [Integrating with C++ rules](/configure/integrate-cpp)

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

In addition to [general Bazel best practices](/configure/best-practices), below are
best practices specific to C++ projects.

### BUILD files {:#build-files}

Follow the guidelines below when creating your BUILD files:

*  Each `BUILD` file should contain one [`cc_library`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library)
   rule target per compilation unit in the directory.

*  You should granularize your C++ libraries as much as
   possible to maximize incrementality and parallelize the build.

*  If there is a single source file in `srcs`, name the library the same as
   that C++ file's name. This library should contain C++ file(s), any matching
   header file(s), and the library's direct dependencies. For example:

   ```python
   cc_library(
       name = "mylib",
       srcs = ["mylib.cc"],
       hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
       deps = [":lower-level-lib"]
   )
   ```

*  Use one `cc_test` rule target per `cc_library` target in the file. Name the
   target `[library-name]_test` and the source file `[library-name]_test.cc`.
   For example, a test target for the `mylib` library target shown above would
   look like this:

   ```python
   cc_test(
       name = "mylib_test",
       srcs = ["mylib_test.cc"],
       deps = [":mylib"]
   )
   ```

### Include paths {:#include-paths}

Follow these guidelines for include paths:

*  Make all include paths relative to the workspace directory.

*  Use quoted includes (`#include "foo/bar/baz.h"`) for non-system headers, not
   angle-brackets (`#include <foo/bar/baz.h>`).

*  Avoid using UNIX directory shortcuts, such as `.` (current directory) or `..`
   (parent directory).

*  For legacy or `third_party` code that requires includes pointing outside the
   project repository, such as external repository includes requiring a prefix,
   use the [`include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.include_prefix) and
   [`strip_include_prefix`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library.strip_include_prefix)
   arguments on the `cc_library` rule target.

### Toolchain features {:#toolchain-features}

The following optional [features](/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#features)
can improve the hygiene of a C++ project. They can be enabled using the
`--features` command-line flag or the `features` attribute of
[`repo`](/external/overview#repo.bazel),
[`package`](/reference/be/functions#package) or `cc_*` rules:

* The `parse_headers` feature makes it so that the C++ compiler is used to parse
  (but not compile) all header files in the built targets and their dependencies
  when using the
  [`--process_headers_in_dependencies`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--process_headers_in_dependencies)
  flag. This can help catch issues in header-only libraries and ensure that
  headers are self-contained and independent of the order in which they are
  included.
* The `layering_check` feature enforces that targets only include headers
  provided by their direct dependencies. The default toolchain supports this
  feature on Linux with `clang` as the compiler.


Project: /_project.yaml
Book: /_book.yaml

# Configurable Build Attributes

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

**_Configurable attributes_**, commonly known as [`select()`](
/reference/be/functions#select), is a Bazel feature that lets users toggle the values
of build rule attributes at the command line.

This can be used, for example, for a multiplatform library that automatically
chooses the appropriate implementation for the architecture, or for a
feature-configurable binary that can be customized at build time.

## Example {:#configurable-build-example}

```python
# myapp/BUILD

cc_binary(
    name = "mybinary",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = select({
        ":arm_build": [":arm_lib"],
        ":x86_debug_build": [":x86_dev_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":generic_lib"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "arm_build",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_debug_build",
    values = {
        "cpu": "x86",
        "compilation_mode": "dbg",
    },
)
```

This declares a `cc_binary` that "chooses" its deps based on the flags at the
command line. Specifically, `deps` becomes:

<table>
  <tr style="background: #E9E9E9; font-weight: bold">
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>deps =</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=arm</code></td>
    <td><code>[":arm_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=x86</code></td>
    <td><code>[":x86_dev_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bazel build //myapp:mybinary -c dbg --cpu=ppc</code></td>
    <td><code>[":generic_lib"]</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

`select()` serves as a placeholder for a value that will be chosen based on
*configuration conditions*, which are labels referencing [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)
targets. By using `select()` in a configurable attribute, the attribute
effectively adopts different values when different conditions hold.

Matches must be unambiguous: if multiple conditions match then either:

*  They all resolve to the same value. For example, when running on linux x86, this is unambiguous
   `{"@platforms//os:linux": "Hello", "@platforms//cpu:x86_64": "Hello"}` because both branches resolve to "hello".
*  One's `values` is a strict superset of all others'. For example, `values = {"cpu": "x86", "compilation_mode": "dbg"}`
   is an unambiguous specialization of `values = {"cpu": "x86"}`.

The built-in condition [`//conditions:default`](#default-condition) automatically matches when
nothing else does.

While this example uses `deps`, `select()` works just as well on `srcs`,
`resources`, `cmd`, and most other attributes. Only a small number of attributes
are *non-configurable*, and these are clearly annotated. For example,
`config_setting`'s own
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute is non-configurable.

## `select()` and dependencies {:#select-and-dependencies}

Certain attributes change the build parameters for all transitive dependencies
under a target. For example, `genrule`'s `tools` changes `--cpu` to the CPU of
the machine running Bazel (which, thanks to cross-compilation, may be different
than the CPU the target is built for). This is known as a
[configuration transition](/reference/glossary#transition).

Given

```python
#myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "arm_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

genrule(
    name = "my_genrule",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["g_arm.src"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["g_x86.src"],
    }),
    tools = select({
        ":arm_cpu": [":tool1"],
        ":x86_cpu": [":tool2"],
    }),
)

cc_binary(
    name = "tool1",
    srcs = select({
        ":arm_cpu": ["armtool.cc"],
        ":x86_cpu": ["x86tool.cc"],
    }),
)
```

running

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_genrule --cpu=arm
```

on an `x86` developer machine binds the build to `g_arm.src`, `tool1`, and
`x86tool.cc`. Both of the `select`s attached to `my_genrule` use `my_genrule`'s
build parameters, which include `--cpu=arm`. The `tools` attribute changes
`--cpu` to `x86` for `tool1` and its transitive dependencies. The `select` on
`tool1` uses `tool1`'s build parameters, which include `--cpu=x86`.

## Configuration conditions {:#configuration-conditions}

Each key in a configurable attribute is a label reference to a
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting) or
[`constraint_value`](/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#constraint_value).

`config_setting` is just a collection of
expected command line flag settings. By encapsulating these in a target, it's
easy to maintain "standard" conditions users can reference from multiple places.

`constraint_value` provides support for [multi-platform behavior](#platforms).

### Built-in flags {:#built-in-flags}

Flags like `--cpu` are built into Bazel: the build tool natively understands
them for all builds in all projects. These are specified with
[`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    values = {
        "flag1": "value1",
        "flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

`flagN` is a flag name (without `--`, so `"cpu"` instead of `"--cpu"`). `valueN`
is the expected value for that flag. `:meaningful_condition_name` matches if
*every* entry in `values` matches. Order is irrelevant.

`valueN` is parsed as if it was set on the command line. This means:

*  `values = { "compilation_mode": "opt" }` matches `bazel build -c opt`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "true" }` matches `bazel build --force_pic=1`
*  `values = { "force_pic": "0" }` matches `bazel build --noforce_pic`

`config_setting` only supports flags that affect target behavior. For example,
[`--show_progress`](/docs/user-manual#show-progress) isn't allowed because
it only affects how Bazel reports progress to the user. Targets can't use that
flag to construct their results. The exact set of supported flags isn't
documented. In practice, most flags that "make sense" work.

### Custom flags {:#custom-flags}

You can model your own project-specific flags with
[Starlark build settings][BuildSettings]. Unlike built-in flags, these are
defined as build targets, so Bazel references them with target labels.

These are triggered with [`config_setting`](/reference/be/general#config_setting)'s
[`flag_values`](/reference/be/general#config_setting.flag_values)
attribute:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "meaningful_condition_name",
    flag_values = {
        "//myflags:flag1": "value1",
        "//myflags:flag2": "value2",
        ...
    },
)
```

Behavior is the same as for [built-in flags](#built-in-flags). See [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/select_on_build_setting){: .external}
for a working example.

[`--define`](/reference/command-line-reference#flag--define)
is an alternative legacy syntax for custom flags (for example
`--define foo=bar`). This can be expressed either in the
[values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.values) attribute
(`values = {"define": "foo=bar"}`) or the
[define_values](/reference/be/general#config_setting.define_values) attribute
(`define_values = {"foo": "bar"}`). `--define` is only supported for backwards
compatibility. Prefer Starlark build settings whenever possible.

`values`, `flag_values`, and `define_values` evaluate independently. The
`config_setting` matches if all values across all of them match.

## The default condition {:#default-condition}

The built-in condition `//conditions:default` matches when no other condition
matches.

Because of the "exactly one match" rule, a configurable attribute with no match
and no default condition emits a `"no matching conditions"` error. This can
protect against silent failures from unexpected settings:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

config_setting(
    name = "x86_cpu",
    values = {"cpu": "x86"},
)

cc_library(
    name = "x86_only_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":x86_cpu": ["lib.cc"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:x86_only_lib --cpu=arm
ERROR: Configurable attribute "srcs" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //myapp:x86_cpu
```

For even clearer errors, you can set custom messages with `select()`'s
[`no_match_error`](#custom-error-messages) attribute.

## Platforms {:#platforms}

While the ability to specify multiple flags on the command line provides
flexibility, it can also be burdensome to individually set each one every time
you want to build a target.
   [Platforms](/extending/platforms)
let you consolidate these into simple bundles.

```python
# myapp/BUILD

sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":basalt": ["pyroxene.sh"],
        ":marble": ["calcite.sh"],
        "//conditions:default": ["feldspar.sh"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "basalt",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

config_setting(
    name = "marble",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)

# constraint_setting acts as an enum type, and constraint_value as an enum value.
constraint_setting(name = "color")
constraint_value(name = "black", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_value(name = "white", constraint_setting = "color")
constraint_setting(name = "texture")
constraint_value(name = "smooth", constraint_setting = "texture")
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")

platform(
    name = "basalt_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":black",
        ":igneous",
    ],
)

platform(
    name = "marble_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        ":white",
        ":smooth",
        ":metamorphic",
    ],
)
```

The platform can be specified on the command line. It activates the
`config_setting`s that contain a subset of the platform's `constraint_values`,
allowing those `config_setting`s to match in `select()` expressions.

For example, in order to set the `srcs` attribute of `my_rocks` to `calcite.sh`,
you can simply run

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --platforms=//myapp:marble_platform
```

Without platforms, this might look something like

```sh
bazel build //my_app:my_rocks --define color=white --define texture=smooth --define type=metamorphic
```

`select()` can also directly read `constraint_value`s:

```python
constraint_setting(name = "type")
constraint_value(name = "igneous", constraint_setting = "type")
constraint_value(name = "metamorphic", constraint_setting = "type")
sh_binary(
    name = "my_rocks",
    srcs = select({
        ":igneous": ["igneous.sh"],
        ":metamorphic" ["metamorphic.sh"],
    }),
)
```

This saves the need for boilerplate `config_setting`s when you only need to
check against single values.

Platforms are still under development. See the
[documentation](/concepts/platforms) for details.

## Combining `select()`s {:#combining-selects}

`select` can appear multiple times in the same attribute:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"] +
           select({
               ":armeabi_mode": ["armeabi_src.sh"],
               ":x86_mode": ["x86_src.sh"],
           }) +
           select({
               ":opt_mode": ["opt_extras.sh"],
               ":dbg_mode": ["dbg_extras.sh"],
           }),
)
```

Note: Some restrictions apply on what can be combined in the `select`s values:
 - Duplicate labels can appear in different paths of the same `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear within the same path of a `select`.
 - Duplicate labels can *not* appear across multiple combined `select`s (no matter what path)

`select` cannot appear inside another `select`. If you need to nest `selects`
and your attribute takes other targets as values, use an intermediate target:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":armeabi_mode": [":armeabi_lib"],
        ...
    }),
)

sh_library(
    name = "armeabi_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":opt_mode": ["armeabi_with_opt.sh"],
        ...
    }),
)
```

If you need a `select` to match when multiple conditions match, consider [AND
chaining](#and-chaining).

## OR chaining {:#or-chaining}

Consider the following:

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config2": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config3": [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Most conditions evaluate to the same dep. But this syntax is hard to read and
maintain. It would be nice to not have to repeat `[":standard_lib"]` multiple
times.

One option is to predefine the value as a BUILD variable:

```python
STANDARD_DEP = [":standard_lib"]

sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config2": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config3": STANDARD_DEP,
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

This makes it easier to manage the dependency. But it still causes unnecessary
duplication.

For more direct support, use one of the following:

### `selects.with_or` {:#selects-with-or}

The
[with_or](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectswith_or){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing conditions directly inside a `select`:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```

```python
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = selects.with_or({
        (":config1", ":config2", ":config3"): [":standard_lib"],
        ":config4": [":special_lib"],
    }),
)
```

### `selects.config_setting_group` {:#selects-config-setting-or-group}


The
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}
macro in [Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}'s
[`selects`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md){: .external}
module supports `OR`ing multiple `config_setting`s:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//lib:selects.bzl", "selects")
```


```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_or_2",
    match_any = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_or_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike `selects.with_or`, different targets can share `:config1_or_2` across
different attributes.

It's an error for multiple conditions to match unless one is an unambiguous
"specialization" of the others or they all resolve to the same value. See [here](#configurable-build-example) for details.

## AND chaining {:#and-chaining}

If you need a `select` branch to match when multiple conditions match, use the
[Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external} macro
[config_setting_group](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/selects_doc.md#selectsconfig_setting_group){: .external}:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "config1",
    values = {"cpu": "arm"},
)
config_setting(
    name = "config2",
    values = {"compilation_mode": "dbg"},
)
selects.config_setting_group(
    name = "config1_and_2",
    match_all = [":config1", ":config2"],
)
sh_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["always_include.sh"],
    deps = select({
        ":config1_and_2": [":standard_lib"],
        "//conditions:default": [":other_lib"],
    }),
)
```

Unlike OR chaining, existing `config_setting`s can't be directly `AND`ed
inside a `select`. You have to explicitly wrap them in a `config_setting_group`.

## Custom error messages {:#custom-error-messages}

By default, when no condition matches, the target the `select()` is attached to
fails with the error:

```sh
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration (would
a default condition help?).
Conditions checked:
  //tools/cc_target_os:darwin
  //tools/cc_target_os:android
```

This can be customized with the [`no_match_error`](/reference/be/functions#select)
attribute:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select(
        {
            "//tools/cc_target_os:android": [":android_deps"],
            "//tools/cc_target_os:windows": [":windows_deps"],
        },
        no_match_error = "Please build with an Android or Windows toolchain",
    ),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:my_lib
ERROR: Configurable attribute "deps" doesn't match this configuration: Please
build with an Android or Windows toolchain
```

## Rules compatibility {:#rules-compatibility}

Rule implementations receive the *resolved values* of configurable
attributes. For example, given:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

some_rule(
    name = "my_target",
    some_attr = select({
        ":foo_mode": [":foo"],
        ":bar_mode": [":bar"],
    }),
)
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp/my_target --define mode=foo
```

Rule implementation code sees `ctx.attr.some_attr` as `[":foo"]`.

Macros can accept `select()` clauses and pass them through to native
rules. But *they cannot directly manipulate them*. For example, there's no way
for a macro to convert

```python
select({"foo": "val"}, ...)
```

to

```python
select({"foo": "val_with_suffix"}, ...)
```

This is for two reasons.

First, macros that need to know which path a `select` will choose *cannot work*
because macros are evaluated in Bazel's [loading phase](/run/build#loading),
which occurs before flag values are known.
This is a core Bazel design restriction that's unlikely to change any time soon.

Second, macros that just need to iterate over *all* `select` paths, while
technically feasible, lack a coherent UI. Further design is necessary to change
this.

## Bazel query and cquery {:#query-and-cquery}

Bazel [`query`](/query/guide) operates over Bazel's
[loading phase](/reference/glossary#loading-phase).
This means it doesn't know what command line flags a target uses since those
flags aren't evaluated until later in the build (in the
[analysis phase](/reference/glossary#analysis-phase)).
So it can't determine which `select()` branches are chosen.

Bazel [`cquery`](/query/cquery) operates after Bazel's analysis phase, so it has
all this information and can accurately resolve `select()`s.

Consider:

```python
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
```
```python
# myapp/BUILD

string_flag(
    name = "dog_type",
    build_setting_default = "cat"
)

cc_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    deps = select({
        ":long": [":foo_dep"],
        ":short": [":bar_dep"],
    }),
)

config_setting(
    name = "long",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "dachshund"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "short",
    flag_values = {":dog_type": "pug"},
)
```

`query` overapproximates `:my_lib`'s dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel query 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)'
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:foo_dep
//myapp:bar_dep
```

while `cquery` shows its exact dependencies:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'deps(//myapp:my_lib)' --//myapp:dog_type=pug
//myapp:my_lib
//myapp:bar_dep
```

## FAQ {:#faq}

### Why doesn't select() work in macros? {:#faq-select-macro}

select() *does* work in rules! See [Rules compatibility](#rules-compatibility) for
details.

The key issue this question usually means is that select() doesn't work in
*macros*. These are different than *rules*. See the
documentation on [rules](/extending/rules) and [macros](/extending/macros)
to understand the difference.
Here's an end-to-end example:

Define a rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

# Rule implementation: when an attribute is read, all select()s have already
# been resolved. So it looks like a plain old attribute just like any other.
def _impl(ctx):
    name = ctx.attr.name
    allcaps = ctx.attr.my_config_string.upper()  # This works fine on all values.
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)

# Rule declaration:
my_custom_bazel_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = {"my_config_string": attr.string()},
)

# Macro declaration:
def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    allcaps = my_config_string.upper()  # This line won't work with select(s).
    print("My name is " + name + " with custom message: " + allcaps)
```

Instantiate the rule and macro:

```python
# myapp/BUILD

load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_rule")
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_custom_bazel_macro")

my_custom_bazel_rule(
    name = "happy_rule",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "second string",
    }),
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "happy_macro",
    my_config_string = "fixed string",
)

my_custom_bazel_macro(
    name = "sad_macro",
    my_config_string = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "first string",
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": "other string",
    }),
)
```

Building fails because `sad_macro` can't process the `select()`:

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:all
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
ERROR: error loading package 'myapp': Package 'myapp' contains errors.
```

Building succeeds when you comment out `sad_macro`:

```sh
# Comment out sad_macro so it doesn't mess up the build.
$ bazel build //myapp:all
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:5:3: My name is happy_macro with custom message: FIXED STRING.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/hi.bzl:15:3: My name is happy_rule with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

This is impossible to change because *by definition* macros are evaluated before
Bazel reads the build's command line flags. That means there isn't enough
information to evaluate select()s.

Macros can, however, pass `select()`s as opaque blobs to rules:

```python
# myapp/defs.bzl

def my_custom_bazel_macro(name, my_config_string):
    print("Invoking macro " + name)
    my_custom_bazel_rule(
        name = name + "_as_target",
        my_config_string = my_config_string,
    )
```

```sh
$ bazel build //myapp:sad_macro_less_sad
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:23:3: Invoking macro sad_macro_less_sad.
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:15:3: My name is sad_macro_less_sad with custom message: FIRST STRING.
```

### Why does select() always return true? {:#faq-boolean-select}

Because *macros* (but not rules) by definition
[can't evaluate `select()`s](#faq-select-macro), any attempt to do so
usually produces an error:

```sh
ERROR: /myworkspace/myapp/BUILD:17:1: Traceback
  (most recent call last):
File "/myworkspace/myapp/BUILD", line 17
my_custom_bazel_macro(name = "sad_macro", my_config_stri..."}))
File "/myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl", line 4, in
  my_custom_bazel_macro
my_config_string.upper()
type 'select' has no method upper().
```

Booleans are a special case that fail silently, so you should be particularly
vigilant with them:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def my_boolean_macro(boolval):
  print("TRUE" if boolval else "FALSE")

$ cat myapp/BUILD
load("//myapp:defs.bzl", "my_boolean_macro")
my_boolean_macro(
    boolval = select({
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": True,
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:ppc": False,
    }),
)

$ bazel build //myapp:all --cpu=x86
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
$ bazel build //mypro:all --cpu=ppc
DEBUG: /myworkspace/myapp/defs.bzl:4:3: TRUE.
```

This happens because macros don't understand the contents of `select()`.
So what they're really evaluting is the `select()` object itself. According to
[Pythonic](https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html) design
standards, all objects aside from a very small number of exceptions
automatically return true.

### Can I read select() like a dict? {:#faq-inspectable-select}

Macros [can't](#faq-select-macro) evaluate select(s) because macros evaluate before
Bazel knows what the build's command line parameters are. Can they at least read
the `select()`'s dictionary to, for example, add a suffix to each value?

Conceptually this is possible, but [it isn't yet a Bazel feature](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8419).
What you *can* do today is prepare a straight dictionary, then feed it into a
`select()`:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
  for key in select_cmd.keys():
    select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
  native.genrule(
      name = name,
      outs = [name + ".out"],
      srcs = [],
      cmd = "echo " + select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})
        + " > $@"
  )

$ cat myapp/BUILD
selecty_genrule(
    name = "selecty",
    select_cmd = {
        "//third_party/bazel_platforms/cpu:x86_32": "x86 mode",
    },
)

$ bazel build //testapp:selecty --cpu=x86 && cat bazel-genfiles/testapp/selecty.out
x86 mode WITH SUFFIX
```

If you'd like to support both `select()` and native types, you can do this:

```sh
$ cat myapp/defs.bzl
def selecty_genrule(name, select_cmd):
    cmd_suffix = ""
    if type(select_cmd) == "string":
        cmd_suffix = select_cmd + " WITH SUFFIX"
    elif type(select_cmd) == "dict":
        for key in select_cmd.keys():
            select_cmd[key] += " WITH SUFFIX"
        cmd_suffix = select(select_cmd + {"//conditions:default": "default"})

    native.genrule(
        name = name,
        outs = [name + ".out"],
        srcs = [],
        cmd = "echo " + cmd_suffix + "> $@",
    )
```

### Why doesn't select() work with bind()? {:#faq-select-bind}

First of all, do not use `bind()`. It is deprecated in favor of `alias()`.

The technical answer is that [`bind()`](/reference/be/workspace#bind) is a repo
rule, not a BUILD rule.

Repo rules do not have a specific configuration, and aren't evaluated in
the same way as BUILD rules. Therefore, a `select()` in a `bind()` can't
actually evaluate to any specific branch.

Instead, you should use [`alias()`](/reference/be/general#alias), with a `select()` in
the `actual` attribute, to perform this type of run-time determination. This
works correctly, since `alias()` is a BUILD rule, and is evaluated with a
specific configuration.

You can even have a `bind()` target point to an `alias()`, if needed.

```sh
$ cat WORKSPACE
workspace(name = "myapp")
bind(name = "openssl", actual = "//:ssl")
http_archive(name = "alternative", ...)
http_archive(name = "boringssl", ...)

$ cat BUILD
config_setting(
    name = "alt_ssl",
    define_values = {
        "ssl_library": "alternative",
    },
)

alias(
    name = "ssl",
    actual = select({
        "//:alt_ssl": "@alternative//:ssl",
        "//conditions:default": "@boringssl//:ssl",
    }),
)
```

With this setup, you can pass `--define ssl_library=alternative`, and any target
that depends on either `//:ssl` or `//external:ssl` will see the alternative
located at `@alternative//:ssl`.

But really, stop using `bind()`.

### Why doesn't my select() choose what I expect? {:#faq-select-choose-condition}

If `//myapp:foo` has a `select()` that doesn't choose the condition you expect,
use [cquery](/query/cquery) and `bazel config` to debug:

If `//myapp:foo` is the top-level target you're building, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery //myapp:foo <desired build flags>
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

If you're building some other target `//bar` that depends on
//myapp:foo somewhere in its subgraph, run:

```sh
$ bazel cquery 'somepath(//bar, //myapp:foo)' <desired build flags>
//bar:bar   (3ag3193fee94a2)
//bar:intermediate_dep (12e23b9a2b534a)
//myapp:foo (12e23b9a2b534a)
```

The `(12e23b9a2b534a)` next to `//myapp:foo` is a *hash* of the
configuration that resolves `//myapp:foo`'s `select()`. You can inspect its
values with `bazel config`:

```sh
$ bazel config 12e23b9a2b534a
BuildConfigurationValue 12e23b9a2b534a
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.CoreOptions {
  cpu: darwin
  compilation_mode: fastbuild
  ...
}
Fragment com.google.devtools.build.lib.rules.cpp.CppOptions {
  linkopt: [-Dfoo=bar]
  ...
}
...
```

Then compare this output against the settings expected by each `config_setting`.

`//myapp:foo` may exist in different configurations in the same build. See the
[cquery docs](/query/cquery) for guidance on using `somepath` to get the right
one.

Caution: To prevent restarting the Bazel server, invoke `bazel config` with the
same command line flags as the `bazel cquery`. The `config` command relies on
the configuration nodes from the still-running server of the previous command.

### Why doesn't `select()` work with platforms? {:#faq-select-platforms}

Bazel doesn't support configurable attributes checking whether a given platform
is the target platform because the semantics are unclear.

For example:

```py
platform(
    name = "x86_linux_platform",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

In this `BUILD` file, which `select()` should be used if the target platform has both the
`@platforms//cpu:x86` and `@platforms//os:linux` constraints, but is **not** the
`:x86_linux_platform` defined here? The author of the `BUILD` file and the user
who defined the separate platform may have different ideas.

#### What should I do instead?

Instead, define a `config_setting` that matches **any** platform with
these constraints:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_x86_linux",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86",
        "@platforms//os:linux",
    ],
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_x86_linux": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

This process defines specific semantics, making it clearer to users what
platforms meet the desired conditions.

#### What if I really, really want to `select` on the platform?

If your build requirements specifically require checking the platform, you
can flip the value of the `--platforms` flag in a `config_setting`:

```py
config_setting(
    name = "is_specific_x86_linux_platform",
    values = {
        "platforms": ["//package:x86_linux_platform"],
    },
)

cc_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [...],
    linkopts = select({
        ":is_specific_x86_linux_platform": ["--enable_x86_optimizations"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

The Bazel team doesn't endorse doing this; it overly constrains your build and
confuses users when the expected condition does not match.

<p class="lead">Fast iterative development for Android</p>

This page describes how `bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development
for Android much faster. It describes the benefits of this approach versus the
challenges of the traditional app install method.

## Summary {:#summary}

To install small changes to an Android app very quickly, do the following:

 1. Find the `android_binary` rule of the app you want to install.
 2. Disable Proguard by removing the `proguard_specs` attribute.
 3. Set the `multidex` attribute to `native`.
 4. Set the `dex_shards` attribute to `10`.
 5. Connect your device running ART (not Dalvik) over USB and enable USB
    debugging on it.
 6. Run `bazel mobile-install :your_target`. App startup will be a little
    slower than usual.
 7. Edit the code or Android resources.
 8. Run `bazel mobile-install --incremental :your_target`.
 9. Enjoy not having to wait a lot.

Some command line options to Bazel that may be useful:

 - `--adb` tells Bazel which adb binary to use
 - `--adb_arg` can be used to  add extra arguments to the command line of `adb`.
   One useful application of this is to select which device you want to install
   to if you have multiple devices connected to your workstation:
   `bazel mobile-install --adb_arg=-s --adb_arg=<SERIAL> :your_target`
 - `--start_app` automatically starts the app

When in doubt, look at the
[example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/examples/android){: .external}
or [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss){: .external}.

## Introduction {:#introduction}

One of the most important attributes of a developer's toolchain is speed: there
is a world of difference between changing the code and seeing it run within a
second and having to wait minutes, sometimes hours, before you get any feedback
on whether your changes do what you expect them to.

Unfortunately, the traditional Android toolchain for building an .apk entails
many monolithic, sequential steps and all of these have to be done in order to
build an Android app. At Google, waiting five minutes to build a single-line
change was not unusual on larger projects like Google Maps.

`bazel mobile-install` makes iterative development for Android much faster by
using a combination of change pruning, work sharding, and clever manipulation of
Android internals, all without changing any of your app's code.

## Problems with traditional app installation {:#problems-app-install}

Building an Android app has some issues, including:

- Dexing. By default, "dx" is invoked exactly once in the build and it does not
know how to reuse work from previous builds: it dexes every method again, even
though only one method was changed.

- Uploading data to the device. adb does not use the full bandwidth of a USB 2.0
connection, and larger apps can take a lot of time to upload. The entire app is
uploaded, even if only small parts have changed, for example, a resource or a
single method, so this can be a major bottleneck.

- Compilation to native code. Android L introduced ART, a new Android runtime,
which compiles apps ahead-of-time rather than compiling them just-in-time like
Dalvik. This makes apps much faster at the cost of longer installation
time. This is a good tradeoff for users because they typically install an app
once and use it many times, but results in slower development where an app is
installed many times and each version is run at most a handful of times.

## The approach of `bazel mobile-install` {:#approach-mobile-install}

`bazel mobile-install `makes the following improvements:

 - Sharded dexing. After building the app's Java code, Bazel shards the class
   files into approximately equal-sized parts and invokes `dx` separately on
   them. `dx` is not invoked on shards that did not change since the last build.

 - Incremental file transfer. Android resources, .dex files, and native
   libraries are removed from the main .apk and are stored in under a separate
   mobile-install directory. This makes it possible to update code and Android
   resources independently without reinstalling the whole app. Thus,
   transferring the files takes less time and only the .dex files that have
   changed are recompiled on-device.

 - Loading parts of the app from outside the .apk. A tiny stub application is
   put into the .apk that loads Android resources, Java code and native code
   from the on-device mobile-install directory, then transfers control to the
   actual app. This is all transparent to the app, except in a few corner cases
   described below.

### Sharded Dexing {:#sharded-dexing}

Sharded dexing is reasonably straightforward: once the .jar files are built, a
[tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/ziputils/DexMapper.java){: .external}
shards them into separate .jar files of approximately equal size, then invokes
`dx` on those that were changed since the previous build. The logic that
determines which shards to dex is not specific to Android: it just uses the
general change pruning algorithm of Bazel.

The first version of the sharding algorithm simply ordered the .class files
alphabetically, then cut the list up into equal-sized parts, but this proved to
be suboptimal: if a class was added or removed (even a nested or an anonymous
one), it would cause all the classes alphabetically after it to shift by one,
resulting in dexing those shards again. Thus, it was decided to shard Java
packages rather than individual classes. Of course, this still results in
dexing many shards if a new package is added or removed, but that is much less
frequent than adding or removing a single class.

The number of shards is controlled by the BUILD file (using the
`android_binary.dex_shards` attribute). In an ideal world, Bazel would
automatically determine how many shards are best, but Bazel currently must know
the set of actions (for example, commands to be executed during the build) before
executing any of them, so it cannot determine the optimal number of shards
because it doesn't know how many Java classes there will eventually be in the
app. Generally speaking, the more shards, the faster the build and the
installation will be, but the slower app startup becomes, because the dynamic
linker has to do more work. The sweet spot is usually between 10 and 50 shards.

### Incremental file transfer {:#incremental-file-transfer}

After building the app, the next step is to install it, preferably with the
least effort possible. Installation consists of the following steps:

 1. Installing the .apk (typically using `adb install`)
 2. Uploading the .dex files, Android resources, and native libraries to the
    mobile-install directory

There is not much incrementality in the first step: the app is either installed
or not. Bazel currently relies on the user to indicate if it should do this step
through the `--incremental` command line option because it cannot determine in
all cases if it is necessary.

In the second step, the app's files from the build are compared to an on-device
manifest file that lists which app files are on the device and their
checksums. Any new files are uploaded to the device, any files that have changed
are updated, and any files that have been removed are deleted from the
device. If the manifest is not present, it is assumed that every file needs to
be uploaded.

Note that it is possible to fool the incremental installation algorithm by
changing a file on the device, but not its checksum in the manifest. This could
have been safeguarded against by computing the checksum of the files on the
device, but this was deemed to be not worth the increase in installation time.

### The Stub application {:#stub-app}

The stub application is where the magic to load the dexes, native code and
Android resources from the on-device `mobile-install` directory happens.

The actual loading is implemented by subclassing `BaseDexClassLoader` and is a
reasonably well-documented technique. This happens before any of the app's
classes are loaded, so that any application classes that are in the apk can be
placed in the on-device `mobile-install` directory so that they can be updated
without `adb install`.

This needs to happen before any of the
classes of the app are loaded, so that no application class needs to be in the
.apk which would mean that changes to those classes would require a full
re-install.

This is accomplished by replacing the `Application` class specified in
`AndroidManifest.xml` with the
[stub application](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/android/java/com/google/devtools/build/android/incrementaldeployment/StubApplication.java){: .external}. This
takes control when the app is started, and tweaks the class loader and the
resource manager appropriately at the earliest moment (its constructor) using
Java reflection on the internals of the Android framework.

Another thing the stub application does is to copy the native libraries
installed by mobile-install to another location. This is necessary because the
dynamic linker needs the `X` bit to be set on the files, which is not possible to
do for any location accessible by a non-root `adb`.

Once all these things are done, the stub application then instantiates the
actual `Application` class, changing all references to itself to the actual
application within the Android framework.

## Results {:#results}

### Performance {:#performance}

In general, `bazel mobile-install` results in a 4x to 10x speedup of building
and installing large apps after a small change.

The following numbers were computed for a few Google products:

<img src="/docs/images/mobile-install-performance.svg"/>

This, of course, depends on the nature of the change: recompilation after
changing a base library takes more time.

### Limitations {:#limitations}

The tricks the stub application plays don't work in every case.
The following cases highlight where it does not work as expected:

 - When `Context` is cast to the `Application` class in
   `ContentProvider#onCreate()`. This method is called during application
   startup before we have a chance to replace the instance of the `Application`
   class, therefore, `ContentProvider` will still reference the stub application
   instead of the real one. Arguably, this is not a bug since you are not
   supposed to downcast `Context` like this, but this seems to happen in a few
   apps at Google.

 - Resources installed by `bazel mobile-install` are only available from within
   the app. If resources are accessed by other apps via
   `PackageManager#getApplicationResources()`, these resources will be from the
   last non-incremental install.

 - Devices that aren't running ART. While the stub application works well on
   Froyo and later, Dalvik has a bug that makes it think that the app is
   incorrect if its code is distributed over multiple .dex files in certain
   cases, for example, when Java annotations are used in a
   [specific](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78144){: .external}
   way. As long as your app doesn't tickle these bugs, it should work with Dalvik,
   too (note, however, that support for old Android versions isn't exactly our
   focus)

# Using the Android Native Development Kit with Bazel

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

_If you're new to Bazel, please start with the [Building Android with
Bazel](/start/android-app ) tutorial._

## Overview {:#overview}

Bazel can run in many different build configurations, including several that use
the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) toolchain. This means that normal
`cc_library` and `cc_binary` rules can be compiled for Android directly within
Bazel. Bazel accomplishes this by using the `android_ndk_repository` repository
rule.

## Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

Please ensure that you have installed the Android SDK and NDK.

To set up the SDK and NDK, add the following snippet to your `WORKSPACE`:

```python
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidsdk".
    path = "/path/to/sdk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.
)

android_ndk_repository(
    name = "androidndk", # Required. Name *must* be "androidndk".
    path = "/path/to/ndk", # Optional. Can be omitted if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable is set.
)
```

For more information about the `android_ndk_repository` rule, see the [Build
Encyclopedia entry](/reference/be/android#android_ndk_repository).

If you're using a recent version of the Android NDK (r22 and beyond), use the
Starlark implementation of `android_ndk_repository`.
Follow the instructions in
[its README](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk).

## Quick start {:#quick-start}

To build C++ for Android, simply add `cc_library` dependencies to your
`android_binary` or `android_library` rules.

For example, given the following `BUILD` file for an Android app:

```python
# In <project>/app/src/main/BUILD.bazel

cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
)

android_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["java/com/example/android/bazel/MainActivity.java"],
    resource_files = glob(["res/**/*"]),
    custom_package = "com.example.android.bazel",
    manifest = "LibraryManifest.xml",
    deps = [":jni_lib"],
)

android_binary(
    name = "app",
    deps = [":lib"],
    manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
)
```

This `BUILD` file results in the following target graph:

![Example results](/docs/images/android_ndk.png "Build graph results")

**Figure 1.** Build graph of Android project with cc_library dependencies.

To build the app, simply run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //app/src/main:app
```

The `bazel build` command compiles the Java files, Android resource files, and
`cc_library` rules, and packages everything into an APK:

```posix-terminal
$ zipinfo -1 bazel-bin/app/src/main/app.apk
nativedeps
lib/armeabi-v7a/libapp.so
classes.dex
AndroidManifest.xml
...
res/...
...
META-INF/CERT.SF
META-INF/CERT.RSA
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

Bazel compiles all of the cc_libraries into a single shared object (`.so`) file,
targeted for the `armeabi-v7a` ABI by default. To change this or build for
multiple ABIs at the same time, see the section on [configuring the target
ABI](#configuring-target-abi).

## Example setup {:#example-setup}

This example is available in the [Bazel examples
repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/master/android/ndk){: .external}.

In the `BUILD.bazel` file, three targets are defined with the `android_binary`,
`android_library`, and `cc_library` rules.

The `android_binary` top-level target builds the APK.

The `cc_library` target contains a single C++ source file with a JNI function
implementation:

```c++
#include <jni.h>
#include <string>

extern "C"
JNIEXPORT jstring

JNICALL
Java_com_example_android_bazel_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv *env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    std::string hello = "Hello from C++";
    return env->NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
}
```

The `android_library` target specifies the Java sources, resource files, and the
dependency on a `cc_library` target. For this example, `MainActivity.java` loads
the shared object file `libapp.so`, and defines the method signature for the JNI
function:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("app");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       // ...
    }

    public native String stringFromJNI();

}
```

Note: The name of the native library is derived from the name of the top
level `android_binary` target. In this example, it is `app`.

## Configuring the target ABI {:#configuring-target-abi}

To configure the target ABI, use the `--android_platforms` flag as follows:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --android_platforms={{ "<var>" }}comma-separated list of platforms{{ "</var>" }}
```

Just like the `--platforms` flag, the values passed to `--android_platforms` are
the labels of [`platform`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#platform)
targets, using standard constraint values to describe your device.

For example, for an Android device with a 64-bit ARM processor, you'd define
your platform like this:

```py
platform(
    name = "android_arm64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:android",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm64",
    ],
)
```

Every Android `platform` should use the [`@platforms//os:android`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms/blob/33a3b209f94856193266871b1545054afb90bb28/os/BUILD#L36)
OS constraint. To migrate the CPU constraint, check this chart:

CPU Value     | Platform
------------- | ------------------------------------------
`armeabi-v7a` | `@platforms//cpu:armv7`
`arm64-v8a`   | `@platforms//cpu:arm64`
`x86`         | `@platforms//cpu:x86_32`
`x86_64`      | `@platforms//cpu:x86_64`

And, of course, for a multi-architecture APK, you pass multiple labels, for
example: `--android_platforms=//:arm64,//:x86_64` (assuming you defined those in
your top-level `BUILD.bazel` file).

Bazel is unable to select a default Android platform, so one must be defined and
specified with `--android_platforms`.

Depending on the NDK revision and Android API level, the following ABIs are
available:

| NDK revision | ABIs                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 16 and lower | armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, mips64, x86, x86\_64 |
| 17 and above | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86\_64                        |

See [the NDK docs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html){: .external}
for more information on these ABIs.

Multi-ABI Fat APKs are not recommended for release builds since they increase
the size of the APK, but can be useful for development and QA builds.

## Selecting a C++ standard {:#selecting-c-standard}

Use the following flags to build according to a C++ standard:

| C++ Standard | Flag                    |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| C++98        | Default, no flag needed |
| C++11        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++11`   |
| C++14        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++14`   |
| C++17        | `--cxxopt=-std=c++17`   |

For example:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:app --cxxopt=-std=c++11
```

Read more about passing compiler and linker flags with `--cxxopt`, `--copt`, and
`--linkopt` in the [User Manual](/docs/user-manual#cxxopt).

Compiler and linker flags can also be specified as attributes in `cc_library`
using `copts` and `linkopts`. For example:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "jni_lib",
    srcs = ["cpp/native-lib.cpp"],
    copts = ["-std=c++11"],
    linkopts = ["-ldl"], # link against libdl
)
```

## Building a `cc_library` for Android without using `android_binary` {:#cclibrary-android}

To build a standalone `cc_binary` or `cc_library` for Android without using an
`android_binary`, use the `--platforms` flag.

For example, assuming you have defined Android platforms in
`my/platforms/BUILD`:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target \
      --platforms=//my/platforms:x86_64
```

With this approach, the entire build tree is affected.

Note: All of the targets on the command line must be compatible with
building for Android when specifying these flags, which may make it difficult to
use [Bazel wild-cards](/run/build#specifying-build-targets) like
`/...` and `:all`.

These flags can be put into a `bazelrc` config (one for each ABI), in
`{{ "<var>" }}project{{ "</var>" }}/.bazelrc`:

```
common:android_x86 --platforms=//my/platforms:x86

common:android_armeabi-v7a --platforms=//my/platforms:armeabi-v7a

# In general
common:android_<abi> --platforms=//my/platforms:<abi>
```

Then, to build a `cc_library` for `x86` for example, run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //my/cc/jni:target --config=android_x86
```

In general, use this method for low-level targets (like `cc_library`) or when
you know exactly what you're building; rely on the automatic configuration
transitions from `android_binary` for high-level targets where you're expecting
to build a lot of targets you don't control.

# C++ Toolchain Configuration

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

## Overview {:#overview}

To invoke the compiler with the right options, Bazel needs some knowledge about
the compiler internals, such as include directories and important flags.
In other words, Bazel needs a simplified model of the compiler to understand its
workings.

Bazel needs to know the following:

* Whether the compiler supports thinLTO, modules, dynamic linking, or PIC
  (position independent code).
* Paths to the required tools such as gcc, ld, ar, objcopy, and so on.
* The built-in system include directories. Bazel needs these to validate that
  all headers that were included in the source file were properly declared in
  the `BUILD` file.
* The default sysroot.
* Which flags to use for compilation, linking, archiving.
* Which flags to use for the supported compilation modes (opt, dbg, fastbuild).
* Make variables specifically required by the compiler.

If the compiler has support for multiple architectures, Bazel needs to configure
them separately.

[`CcToolchainConfigInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/CcToolchainConfigInfo) is a provider that provides the necessary level of
granularity for configuring the behavior of Bazel's C++ rules. By default,
Bazel automatically configures `CcToolchainConfigInfo` for your build, but you
have the option to configure it manually. For that, you need a Starlark rule
that provides the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` and you need to point the
[`toolchain_config`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain.toolchain_config) attribute of the
[`cc_toolchain`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain) to your rule.
You can create the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` by calling
[`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info()`](/rules/lib/toplevel/cc_common#create_cc_toolchain_config_info).
You can find Starlark constructors for all structs you'll need in the process in
[`@rules_cc//cc:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/blob/master/cc/cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl){: .external}.


When a C++ target enters the analysis phase, Bazel selects the appropriate
`cc_toolchain` target based on the `BUILD` file, and obtains the
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider from the target specified in the
`cc_toolchain.toolchain_config` attribute. The `cc_toolchain` target
passes this information to the C++ target through a `CcToolchainProvider`.

For example, a compile or link action, instantiated by a rule such as
`cc_binary` or `cc_library`, needs the following information:

*   The compiler or linker to use
*   Command-line flags for the compiler/linker
*   Configuration flags passed through the `--copt/--linkopt` options
*   Environment variables
*   Artifacts needed in the sandbox in which the action executes

All of the above information except the artifacts required in the sandbox is
specified in the Starlark target that the `cc_toolchain` points to.

The artifacts to be shipped to the sandbox are declared in the `cc_toolchain`
target. For example, with the `cc_toolchain.linker_files` attribute you can
specify the linker binary and toolchain libraries to ship into the sandbox.

## Toolchain selection {:#toolchain-selection}

The toolchain selection logic operates as follows:

1.  User specifies a `cc_toolchain_suite` target in the `BUILD` file and points
    Bazel to the target using the
    [`--crosstool_top` option](/docs/user-manual#flag--crosstool_top).

2.  The `cc_toolchain_suite` target references multiple toolchains. The
    values of the `--cpu` and `--compiler` flags determine which of those
    toolchains is selected, either based only on the `--cpu` flag value, or
    based on a joint `--cpu | --compiler` value. The selection process is as
    follows:

  * If the `--compiler` option is specified, Bazel selects the
        corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
        attribute with `--cpu | --compiler`. If Bazel does not find
        a corresponding entry, it throws an error.

  * If the `--compiler` option is not specified, Bazel selects
    the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains`
    attribute with just `--cpu`.

  * If no flags are specified, Bazel inspects the host system and selects a
    `--cpu` value based on its findings. See the
    [inspection mechanism code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/1b73bc37e184e71651eb631223dcce321ba16211:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/AutoCpuConverter.java).

Once a toolchain has been selected, corresponding `feature` and `action_config`
objects in the Starlark rule govern the configuration of the build (that is,
items described later). These messages allow the implementation of
fully fledged C++ features in Bazel without modifying the
Bazel binary. C++ rules support multiple unique actions documented in detail
[in the Bazel source code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/4f547a7ea86df80e4c76145ffdbb0c8b75ba3afa:tools/build_defs/cc/action_names.bzl).

## Features {:#features}

A feature is an entity that requires command-line flags, actions,
constraints on the execution environment, or dependency alterations. A feature
can be something as simple as allowing `BUILD` files to select configurations of
flags, such as `treat_warnings_as_errors`, or interact with the C++ rules and
include new compile actions and inputs to the compilation, such as
`header_modules` or `thin_lto`.

Ideally, `CcToolchainConfigInfo` contains a list of features, where each
feature consists of one or more flag groups, each defining a list of flags
that apply to specific Bazel actions.

A feature is specified by name, which allows full decoupling of the Starlark
rule configuration from Bazel releases. In other words, a Bazel release does not
affect the behavior of `CcToolchainConfigInfo` configurations as long as those
configurations do not require the use of new features.

A feature is enabled in one of the following ways:

*  The feature's `enabled` field is set to `true`.
*  Bazel or the rule owner explicitly enable it.
*  The user enables it through the `--feature` Bazel option or `features` rule
   attribute.

Features can have interdependencies, depend on command line flags, `BUILD` file
settings, and other variables.

### Feature relationships {:#feature-relationships}

Dependencies are typically managed directly with Bazel, which simply enforces
the requirements and manages conflicts intrinsic to the nature of the features
defined in the build. The toolchain specification allows for more granular
constraints for use directly within the Starlark rule that govern feature
support and expansion. These are:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Constraint</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>requires = [
   feature_set (features = [
       'feature-name-1',
       'feature-name-2'
   ]),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Feature-level. The feature is supported only if the specified required
       features are enabled. For example, when a feature is only supported in
       certain build modes (<code>opt</code>, <code>dbg</code>, or
       <code>fastbuild</code>). If `requires` contains multiple `feature_set`s
       the feature is supported if any of the `feature_set`s is satisfied
       (when all specified features are enabled).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>implies = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. This feature implies the specified feature(s).
       Enabling a feature also implicitly enables all features implied by it
       (that is, it functions recursively).</p>
       <p>Also provides the ability to factor common subsets of functionality out of
       a set of features, such as the common parts of sanitizers. Implied
       features cannot be disabled.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>provides = ['feature']</pre>
   </td>
   <td><p>Feature-level. Indicates that this feature is one of several mutually
       exclusive alternate features. For example, all of the sanitizers could
       specify <code>provides = ["sanitizer"]</code>.</p>
       <p>This improves error handling by listing the alternatives if the user asks
       for two or more mutually exclusive features at once.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>with_features = [
  with_feature_set(
    features = ['feature-1'],
    not_features = ['feature-2'],
  ),
]</pre>
   </td>
   <td>Flag set-level. A feature can specify multiple flag sets with multiple.
     When <code>with_features</code> is specified, the flag set will only expand
     to the build command if there is at least one <code>with_feature_set</code>
     for which all of the features in the specified <code>features</code> set
     are enabled, and all the features specified in <code>not_features</code>
     set are disabled.
     If <code>with_features</code> is not specified, the flag set will be
     applied unconditionally for every action specified.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Actions {:#actions}

Actions provide the flexibility to modify the circumstances under
which an action executes without assuming how the action will be run. An
`action_config` specifies the tool binary that an action invokes, while a
`feature` specifies the configuration (flags) that determine how that tool
behaves when the action is invoked.

[Features](#features) reference actions to signal which Bazel actions
they affect since actions can modify the Bazel action graph. The
`CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider contains actions that have flags and tools
associated with them, such as `c++-compile`. Flags are assigned to each action
by associating them with a feature.

Each action name represents a single type of action performed by Bazel, such as
compiling or linking. There is, however, a many-to-one relationship between
actions and Bazel action types, where a Bazel action type refers to a Java class
that implements an action (such as `CppCompileAction`). In particular, the
"assembler actions" and "compiler actions" in the table below are
`CppCompileAction`, while the link actions are `CppLinkAction`.

### Assembler actions {:#assembler-actions}

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>assemble</code>
   </td>
   <td>Assemble without preprocessing. Typically for <code>.s</code> files.
   </td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>c++-link-executable</code>
   </td>
   <td>Link a final ready-to-run library.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### AR actions {:#ar-actions}

AR actions assemble object files into archive libraries (`.a` files) via `ar`
and encode some semantics into the name.

<table>
  <col width="300">

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Action</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>c++-link-static-library</code>
   </td>
   <td>Create a static library (archive).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### LTO actions {:#lto-actions}

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Action</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>lto-backend</code>
   </td>
   <td>ThinLTO action compiling bitcodes into native objects.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>lto-index</code>
   </td>
   <td>ThinLTO action generating global index.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Using action_config {:#using-action-config}

The `action_config` is a Starlark struct that describes a Bazel
action by specifying the tool (binary) to invoke during the action and sets of
flags, defined by features. These flags apply constraints to the action's
execution.

The `action_config()` constructor has the following parameters:

<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Attribute</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>action_name</code>
   </td>
    <td>The Bazel action to which this action corresponds.
        Bazel uses this attribute to discover per-action tool and execution
        requirements.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>tools</code>
   </td>
   <td>The executable to invoke. The tool applied to the action will be the
       first tool in the list with a feature set that matches the feature
       configuration. Default value must be provided.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>flag_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of flags that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a
       feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>env_sets</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of environment constraints that applies to a group of actions.
       Same as for a feature.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

An `action_config` can require and imply other features and
<code>action_config</code>s as dictated by the
[feature relationships](#feature-relationships) described earlier. This behavior
is similar to that of a feature.

The last two attributes are redundant against the corresponding attributes on
features and are included because some Bazel actions require certain flags or
environment variables and the goal is to avoid unnecessary `action_config`+`feature`
pairs. Typically, sharing a single feature across multiple `action_config`s is
preferred.

You can not define more than one `action_config` with the same `action_name`
within the same toolchain. This prevents ambiguity in tool paths
and enforces the intention behind `action_config` - that an action's properties
are clearly described in a single place in the toolchain.

### Using tool constructor {:#using-tool-constructor}

An`action_config` can specify a set of tools via its `tools` parameter.
The `tool()` constructor takes in the following parameters:


<table>
  <col width="300">
  <col width="600">
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>path</code>
   </td>
   <td>Path to the tool in question (relative to the current location).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>with_features</code>
   </td>
   <td>A list of feature sets out of which at least one must be satisfied
       for this tool to apply.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For a given `action_config`, only a single `tool` applies
its tool path and execution requirements to the Bazel action. A tool is selected
by iterating through the `tools` attribute on an `action_config` until a tool
with a `with_feature` set matching the feature configuration is found
(see [Feature relationships](#feature-relationships) earlier on this page
for more information). You should end your tool lists with a default
tool that corresponds to an empty feature configuration.

### Example usage {:#example-usage}

Features and actions can be used together to implement Bazel actions
with diverse cross-platform semantics. For example, debug symbol generation on
macOS requires generating symbols in the compile action, then invoking a
specialized tool during the link action to create  compressed dsym archive, and
then decompressing that archive to produce the application bundle and `.plist`
files consumable by Xcode.

With Bazel, this process can instead be implemented as follows, with
`unbundle-debuginfo` being a Bazel action:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            action_name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    with_features = [
                        with_feature(features=["generate-debug-symbols"]),
                    ],
                    path = "toolchain/mac/ld-with-dsym-packaging",
                ),
                tool (path = "toolchain/mac/ld"),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature(
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set (
                    actions = [
                        ACTION_NAMES.c_compile,
                        ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile
                    ],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-g"],
                        ),
                    ],
                )
            ],
            implies = ["unbundle-debuginfo"],
       ),
    ]


This same feature can be implemented entirely differently for Linux, which uses
`fission`, or for Windows, which produces `.pdb` files. For example, the
implementation for `fission`-based debug symbol generation might look as
follows:

    load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

    action_configs = [
        action_config (
            name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile,
            tools = [
                tool(
                    path = "toolchain/bin/gcc",
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ]

    features = [
        feature (
            name = "generate-debug-symbols",
            requires = [with_feature_set(features = ["dbg"])],
            flag_sets = [
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-gsplit-dwarf"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
                flag_set(
                    actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable],
                    flag_groups = [
                        flag_group(
                            flags = ["-Wl", "--gdb-index"],
                        ),
                    ],
                ),
          ],
        ),
    ]


### Flag groups {:#flag-groups}

`CcToolchainConfigInfo` allows you to bundle flags into groups that serve a
specific purpose. You can specify a flag within using pre-defined variables
within the flag value, which the compiler expands when adding the flag to the
build command. For example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["%{output_execpath}"],
    )


In this case, the contents of the flag will be replaced by the output file path
of the action.

Flag groups are expanded to the build command in the order in which they appear
in the list, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

For flags that need to repeat with different values when added to the build
command, the flag group can iterate variables of type `list`. For example, the
variable `include_path` of type `list`:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I<path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list. All
flags (or `flag_group`s) in the body of a flag group declaration are expanded as
a unit. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-I", "%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to `-I <path>` for each path element in the `include_paths` list.

A variable can repeat multiple times. For example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "include_paths",
        flags = ["-iprefix=%{include_paths}", "-isystem=%{include_paths}"],
    )

expands to:

    -iprefix=<inc0> -isystem=<inc0> -iprefix=<inc1> -isystem=<inc1>

Variables can correspond to structures accessible using dot-notation. For
example:

    flag_group (
        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.name}"],
    )

Structures can be nested and may also contain sequences. To prevent name clashes
and to be explicit, you must specify the full path through the fields. For
example:

    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
            ),
        ],
    )


### Conditional expansion {:#conditional-expansion}

Flag groups support conditional expansion based on the presence of a particular
variable or its field using the `expand_if_available`, `expand_if_not_available`,
`expand_if_true`, `expand_if_false`, or `expand_if_equal` attributes. For example:


    flag_group (
        iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
        flag_groups = [
            flag_group (
                iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--whole_archive"],
                    ),
                    flag_group (
                        flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],

                    flag_group (
                        expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                        flags = ["--no_whole_archive"],

                ],
            ),

Note: The `--whole_archive` and `--no_whole_archive` options are added to
the build command only when a currently iterated library has an
`is_whole_archive` field.

   <td><strong><code>supports_start_end_lib</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>If enabled (and the option <code>--start_end_lib</code> is set), Bazel
     will not link against static libraries but instead use the
     <code>--start-lib/--end-lib</code> linker options to link against objects

     static libraries.

  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>supports_interface_shared_libraries</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>If enabled (and the option <code>--interface_shared_objects</code> is
     set), Bazel will link targets that have <code>linkstatic</code> set to
     False (<code>cc_test</code>s by default) against interface shared
     libraries. This makes incremental relinking faster.

     The `pic` variable is present whenever PIC compilation is needed. If not enabled
     by default, and `--force_pic` is passed, Bazel will request `supports_pic` and
     validate that the feature is enabled. If the feature is missing, or couldn't
      be enabled, `--force_pic` cannot be used.

    <li>Adds <code>compiler_output_flags</code> (if not present) feature to the bottom of the toolchain</li>
  </ul>
</p>

This is a long list of features. The plan is to get rid of them once
[Crosstool in Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380){: .external} is
done. For the curious reader see the implementation in
[CppActionConfigs](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CppActionConfigs.java?q=cppactionconfigs&ss=bazel),
and for production toolchains consider adding `no_legacy_features` to make
the toolchain more standalone.

# Android Build Performance

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page contains information on optimizing build performance for Android
apps specifically. For general build performance optimization with Bazel, see
[Optimizing Performance](/rules/performance).

## Recommended flags {:#recommended-flags}

The flags are in the
[`bazelrc` configuration syntax](/run/bazelrc#bazelrc-syntax-semantics), so
they can be pasted directly into a `bazelrc` file and invoked with
`--config=<configuration_name>` on the command line.

**Profiling performance**

Bazel writes a JSON trace profile by default to a file called
`command.profile.gz` in Bazel's output base.
See the [JSON Profile documentation](/rules/performance#performance-profiling) for
how to read and interact with the profile.

**Persistent workers for Android build actions**.

A subset of Android build actions has support for
[persistent workers](https://blog.bazel.build/2015/12/10/java-workers.html).

These actions' mnemonics are:

*   DexBuilder
*   Javac
*   Desugar
*   AaptPackage
*   AndroidResourceParser
*   AndroidResourceValidator
*   AndroidResourceCompiler
*   RClassGenerator
*   AndroidResourceLink
*   AndroidAapt2
*   AndroidAssetMerger
*   AndroidResourceMerger
*   AndroidCompiledResourceMerger

Enabling workers can result in better build performance by saving on JVM
startup costs from invoking each of these tools, but at the cost of increased
memory usage on the system by persisting them.

To enable workers for these actions, apply these flags with
`--config=android_workers` on the command line:

```
build:android_workers --strategy=DexBuilder=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Javac=worker
build:android_workers --strategy=Desugar=worker

# A wrapper flag for these resource processing actions:
# - AndroidResourceParser
# - AndroidResourceValidator
# - AndroidResourceCompiler
# - RClassGenerator
# - AndroidResourceLink
# - AndroidAapt2
# - AndroidAssetMerger
# - AndroidResourceMerger
# - AndroidCompiledResourceMerger
build:android_workers --persistent_android_resource_processor
```

The default number of persistent workers created per action is `4`. We have
[measured improved build performance](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8586#issuecomment-500070549){: .external}
by capping the number of instances for each action to `1` or `2`, although this
may vary depending on the system Bazel is running on, and the project being
built.

To cap the number of instances for an action, apply these flags:

```
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=DexBuilder=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Javac=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=Desugar=2
build:android_workers --worker_max_instances=AaptPackage=2
# .. and so on for each action you're interested in.
```

**Using AAPT2**

[`aapt2`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2){: .external} has improved
performance over `aapt` and also creates smaller APKs. To use `aapt2`, use the
`--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or set `aapt2` on the `aapt_version` on
`android_binary` and `android_local_test`.

**SSD optimizations**

The `--experimental_multi_threaded_digest` flag is useful for optimizing digest
computation on SSDs.
